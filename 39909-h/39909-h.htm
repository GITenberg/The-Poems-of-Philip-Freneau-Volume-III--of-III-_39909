<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The first trace I can find of this poem is in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, February
2, 1791, where it is entitled "Stanzas written on the Hills of Neversink near
Sandy Hook, 1790." In the republication of the poem in the <i>National Gazette</i>,
November 28, 1791, the month "July" was added to the title. It was the poet's
valedictory to the ocean after his wanderings. He was married in May, 1790, and
he now evidently looked forward to a settled career. The poem has been placed
slightly out of order as will be seen. It was republished only in the 1795 edition
which the text follows. The first five lines of the original version were as follows:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In early days and vanished years<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To rougher toils resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You saw me rove in search of care<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And leave true bliss behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You saw me rig the barque so trim," etc.<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">Maryland</span></h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Laved by vast depths that swell on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Chesapeake intrudes his midway tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay Maryland attracts the admiring eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fertile region with a temperate sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In years elapsed, her heroes of renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From British Anna named one favourite town:<a name="FNanchor_B_17" id="FNanchor_B_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_17" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, lost her commerce, though she guards their laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Baltimore that envied commerce draws.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Few are the years since there, at random placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some wretched huts her quiet-port disgraced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe from all winds, and covered from the bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, at his ease, the thoughtless native lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, rich and great, no more a slave to sloth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She claims importance from her towering growth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in renown, her streets and domes arranged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A groupe of cabins to a city changed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though rich at home, to foreign lands they stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For foreign trappings trade the wealth away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Politest manners through their towns prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasure revels, though their funds should fail;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In each gay dome, soft music charms its lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where female beauty strikes the trembling chord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fine air with nicest touches dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the tongue the according ditty swells:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud to be seen, 'tis their's to place delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dances measured by the winter's night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening feast, that wine and mirth prolong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lamp of splendor, and the midnight song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion here no gloomy garb assumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exchanged her tears for patches and for plumes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blooming belle (untaught heaven's beaus to win)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talks not of seraphs, but the world she's in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attached to earth, here born, and to decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leaves to better worlds all finer clay.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In those, whom choice or different fortunes place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On rural scenes, a different mind we trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There solitude, that still to dullness tends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rustic forms no sprightly action lends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heeds not the garb, mopes o'er the evening fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids the maiden from the man retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On winding floods the lofty mansion stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That casts a mournful view o'er neighbouring lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the sad master strays amidst his grounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directs his negroes, or reviews his hounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then home returning, plies his pasteboard play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dreams o'er wine, that hardly makes him gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If some chance guest arrive in weary plight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He more than bids him welcome for the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind to profusion, spares no pains to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives him the product of his fields and trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his rich board shines plenty from her source,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The meanest dish of all his own discourse.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In the <i>Charleston City Gazette or Daily Advertiser</i> of February 2, 1790,
appeared "A Characteristic Sketch of the Long Island Dutch. From The Rising
Empire: a Poem." Two days later the New York <i>Daily Advertiser</i> published
"A View of Rhode Island. [Extracted from a new Poem, entitled The Rising
Empire, not yet published.]" That Freneau for a time was actively engaged
upon this projected volume is evident from the poems on the states which appeared
in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, chiefly during the month of March, 1790. The last of
these poems, "A Descriptive Sketch of Virginia," appeared June 11, 1790. On
June 25 Freneau issued proposals for a new volume of poems, presumably to bear
the title "The Rising Empire," but the volume was never published. Many of
the pieces that undoubtedly would have gone to make up the book appeared in the
<i>Daily Advertiser</i>. Of those that came directly under the title (and they are
doubtless but a fragment of what the poet intended to write) all but "A View of
Rhode Island" appeared in a greatly changed form in the poet's later volumes.
I have followed in each case the edition of 1809.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_30" id="Footnote_25_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_30"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of June 12, 1790, there appeared from the pen of
Freneau a long article entitled "Description of New-York one Hundred years
hence, By a Citizen of those Times:" The following is an extract:
</p><p>
"At the South western part of this city formerly stood a strong fort, with
stone walls, near thirty feet in height, upon which were mounted a considerable
number of large pieces of cannon. This fortress was originally constructed by the
Dutch possessors of the place to defend the town, then in its infancy, from the
insults of pirates on the one side, and the aborigines of the country on the other.
After this territory fell into the hands of the English nation, the fort was at different
times enlarged, strengthened and repaired, and was the usual place of residence
for the British Governors, who, in the true spirit of European royalty and
despotism chose to live separate from their fellow-citizens, and in several instances
treated them with a degree of contempt and disrespect proportionate to the confidence
they had in the number of their cannon, and in the strength of the walls
and ramparts that surrounded them.
</p><p>
"History mentions that in the year 1790, fourteen years after this republic had
shaken off its yoke of foreign bondage, this fort was totally demolished by an edict
of the Senate, and the space it occupied employed to better purpose in making
room for those elegant streets and buildings which now adorn this quarter of the
city."
</p><p>
The poem appeared in the issue of March 9, 1790, and was entitled "On
the proposed demolition of Fort George, in this City." The text of the 1809
edition has been followed.</p></div>

<span class="i1">On a fine Sunday morning I mounted my steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And southward from Hartford had meant to proceed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My baggage was stow'd in a cart very snug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Ranger, the gelding, was destined to lug;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his harness and buckles, he loom'd very grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was drove by young Darby, a lad of the land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On land, or on water, most handy was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jockey on shore, and a sailor at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew all the roads, he was so very keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Bible by heart, at the age of fifteen.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As thus I jogg'd on, to my saddle confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Ranger and Darby a distance behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last in full view of a steeple we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a cock on the spire (I suppose he was game;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cries Darby&mdash;"Dear master, I beg you to stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believe me, there's danger in driving this way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our deacons on Sundays have power to arrest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead us to church&mdash;if your honour thinks best&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though still I must do them the justice to tell,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class="i1">The fine (said I) Darby, how much may it be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shilling or sixpence?&mdash;why, now let me see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three shillings are all the small pence that remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to change a half joe would be rather profane.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it more than three shillings, the fine that you speak on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What say you good Darby&mdash;will that serve the deacon.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Three shillings (cried Darby) why, master, you're jesting!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us luff while we can and make sure of our westing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forty shillings, excuse me, is too much to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would take my month's wages&mdash;that's all I've to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By taking this road that inclines to the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squire and the sexton may bid us good night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If once to old Ranger I give up the rein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parson himself may pursue us in vain."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Not I, my good Darby (I answer'd the lad)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the church on the left! they would think we were mad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would sooner rely on the heels of my steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pass by them all like a Jehu indeed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As long as I'm able to lead in the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Ranger, the gelding, will go a good pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the deacon pursues, he will fly like a swallow,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Then approaching the church, as we pass'd by the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sexton peep'd out, with a saint or two more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deacon came forward and waved us his hat,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">By this time the deacon had mounted his poney<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since fortune all hope of escaping denies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better give them a little, than lose the whole prize."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarce had he spoke, when we came to a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose muddy condition concluded the chace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down settled the cart&mdash;and old Ranger stuck fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aha! (said the Saint) have I catch'd ye at last?<br /></span>

1790. It was there introduced as follows (italics): "In several parts of New
England it is customary not to suffer travellers to proceed on a journey on the
Sabbath day. If a person is obstinate on these occasions, he is either forcibly
(and commonly to the ridicule of the whole Congregation) conducted to the
Church door, led through the principal ile (<i>sic</i>), and placed in a conspicuous seat
by the wardens, or must be detained till next day under guard, and submit to pay
a fine, or be committed. The following lines commemorate an event of this sort,
which some years ago really befel Mr. P. the noted performer in feats of horsemanship.
The author, however, seems to have left his poem incomplete."

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_35" id="Footnote_30_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_35"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Published in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, March 22, 1790, under the title "On
the Demolition of Dartmouth College." This earliest version was introduced
thus (italics): "On December the 31st last, the old College at Dartmouth in
New-Hampshire, was entirely demolished by the Students, notwithstanding
every endeavour of the Rev. President to persuade them to desist from their unwarrantable
undertaking. It stood the shock of their united efforts about 20
minutes, and then fell to the ground." The facts as given by Freneau are in the
main true. During the absence of the second Wheelock in Europe to secure
funds for the college "Professor Woodward," according to Chase's <i>History of
Dartmouth College</i>, "acted as chief executive and Professor Ripley resided with
the family in the presidential mansion. The students, it seems, took advantage
of the opportunity to rid themselves and the faculty of the little log hut, 'the
first sprout of the college,' that stood near the mansion house. Being remitted to
the occupancy of servants, it was by this time in a deplorable state of neglect and
decay, and obnoxious to everybody. On a December evening in 1782 or 1783
Professor Ripley in the President's house happened to be entertaining a friend
from Connecticut, and dilating with much satisfaction upon the orderly behaviour
of the students and the freedom from noise and disturbance. In the midst of it
they became aware of an unusual commotion without, and on going to see about it,
discovered a body of students assailing the log house in such a manner that in a
very short time little was left of it. The professor made an effort to stay the
work but the noise overpowered his voice." In the edition of 1795 the title was
"On the Demolition of a Log-College," and in the index of the edition of 1809,
the text of which I have used, the title was given "On the Demolition of an
ancient New-England College."</p></div>

<span class="i0">Two trifles, at present, discourage her paw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fear of the Lord, and the fear of the law&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than see them removing to Conegocheague,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the houses and kitchens are yet to be framed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In winter much trouble to keep himself warm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the heat of the summer pursuing his trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No trees, but his topmasts, to yield him a shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, add to the list of the mariner's evils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water corrupted, the bread full of weevils,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><span class="i0">Salt junk to be eat, be it better or worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, often bull beef of an Irishman's horse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whosoever is free, he must still be a slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Despotic is always the rule on the wave;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not relished on water, your lords of the main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhor the republican doctrines of Paine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each, like the despot of Prussia, may say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his crew has no right, but the right to obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such things say the lubbers, and sigh when they've said 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But things are not so bad as their fancies persuade 'em:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There ne'er was a task but afforded some ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor a calling in life, but had something to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the sea has its storms, it has also its calms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A time to sing songs and a time to sing psalms.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;give me a vessel well timbered and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bottom good plank, and in rigging well found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If her spars are but staunch, and her oakham swelled tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tempests and storms I'll extract some delight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sea I would rather have Neptune my jailor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a lubber on shore, that despises a sailor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do they ask me what pleasure I find on the sea?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, absence from land is a pleasure to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hamper of porter, and plenty of grog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friend, when too sleepy, to give me a jog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A coop that will always some poultry afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bottles of gin, and no parson on board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crew that is brisk when it happens to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One compass on deck and another below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A girl, with more sense than the girl at the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read me a novel, or make up my bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that has these, has a treasure in store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That millions possess not, who live upon shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if it should happen that commerce grew dull,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><span class="i0">Or Neptune, ill-humoured, should batter our hull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should damage my cargo, or heave me aground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or pay me with farthings instead of a pound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I always be left in the rear of the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this be forever&mdash;forever the case;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then, if the honest plain truth I may tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would clew up my topsails, and bid him farewell.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beside a stream, that never yet ran dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stands a Town, not high advanced in fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' few its buildings raised to please the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still this proud title it may fairly claim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Tavern (its first requisite) is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mill, a black-smith's shop, a place of prayer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, more&mdash;a little market-house is seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And iron hooks, where beef was never hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pig's head, or sausage link, or bullock's tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look when you will, you see the vacant bench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No butcher seated there, no country wench.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great aims were his, who first contriv'd this town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A market he would have&mdash;but, humbled now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighing, we see its fabric mouldering down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That only serves, at night, to pen the cow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence, by way of jest, it may be said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beef is there, tho' never beef that's dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abreast the inn&mdash;a tree before the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Printing-Office lifts its humble head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where busy Type old journals doth explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For news that is thro' all the village read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, year from year, (so cruel is his lot)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is author, pressman, devil&mdash;and what not?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In sense, not very dull nor very bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shews some marks of humour in his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who can pen an anecdote, complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or plague the parson with the mackled sheet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three times a week, by nimble geldings drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stage arrives; but scarcely deigns to stop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless the driver, far in liquor gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made some business for the black-smith-shop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then comes this printer's harvest-time of news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome alike from Christians, Turks, or Jews.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each passenger he eyes with curious glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if his phiz be mark'd of courteous kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conversation, straight, he makes advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping, from thence, some paragraph to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some odd adventure, something new and rare,<br /></span>

essay upon country taverns. The following is an extract:
</p><p>
"Happy would it be for every community if ardent spirits could be banished
from amongst them.... I shall conclude these observations with some lines
written last winter at a country tavern, where from the introduction of a single <i>jug
of rum</i>, conviviality and good humour were changed into madness and brutality, and
numbers of the guests, who came, perhaps, only to pass a social hour, went away
maimed, muttering, and lastingly embittered against each other." The poem appeared
in the edition of 1795 with the title "The Jug of Rum." Text from the
edition of 1809.</p></div>

here refers to the well-known passage in Burke's <i>Reflections on the Revolution in
France</i>, published October, 1790, in which after describing the queen of France
as he had seen her in 1774 and the "prostrate homage" which her nation had paid
to her at that time, he dwells upon the contrast of 1789: "Oh, what a revolution!
and what a heart must I have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation and
that fall! Little did I dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic,
distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp
antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that I should
have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a
nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must
have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with
insult. But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, &#339;conomists, and
calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever."</p></div>

"Republican dinner" given Genet, May 18, at which about one hundred citizens
were present, chiefly "French, French-Americans, officers of the Frigate
l'Embuscade, etc." The following is from this report:
</p><p>
"After the third toast [The United States], an elegant ode, suited to the occasion,
and composed by Citizen <span class="smcap">Pichon</span>, a young Frenchman of promising abilities,
was read by Citizen <span class="smcap">Duponceau</span>, and universally applauded. The society, on
motion, ordered that Citizen <span class="smcap">Freneau</span> should be requested to translate it into
English verse, and that the original and translation should be published. The
society also unanimously voted that Citizen <span class="smcap">Pichon</span> should be recommended to
the notice of the Minister."
</p><p>
The French version of the Ode appeared in the <i>Advertiser</i> on May 27; the
translation was printed May 31. Both ode and translation were published in
the edition of 1795, the text of which I have followed. It was not republished in
1809. Following is the French text as it appeared in the <i>Advertiser</i>:

French and Citizens, June 1, 1793. The affair is described in detail in Bache's
<i>Aurora</i> of June 4th. After three of the toasts the artillery fired salutes with two
twelve pounders, fifteen rounds each. Freneau's ode was sung after the seventh
toast, "with great effect." As to the date of composition of the ode I can find no
reliable evidence. Conway, in his life of Paine, mentions that it was sung in 1791
at the November Festival of the London Revolution Society. It was published in
the edition of 1795, but was not reproduced in 1809.</p></div>

Jay's treaty with England was laid before the Senate in June, 1795, and after
two weeks of fierce discussion was ratified by a very small majority. The Senate,
fearing popular criticism, forbade the publication of the treaty, a course which
caused such widespread indignation that Mason on his own responsibility gave a
perfect copy of the text to the Philadelphia <i>Aurora</i> for publication. The act was
as much praised by one party as it was condemned by the other.</p></div>

"Among a despicable mess of scurrility in one of Porcupine's Gazettes of
last week, he mentions that 'he was plagued with the Time-Piece for several
months.'&mdash;It has also been a plague to some others of his brethren, and will go
on to be so, till they are hustled into their native dog kennels.&mdash;At the commencement
of the Time-Piece, by way of soliciting an exchange of papers, the
Editor transmitted one copy to each printer of a newspaper in Philadelphia. The
compliment was immediately returned by them all except Porcupine. The Editor
of the Time-Piece was in no want of his dirty vehicle of ribaldry, for the purposes
of compilation. The paper, however, continued to be sent for a few weeks,
till finding the hoggishness of the fellow, in not consenting to an exchange, the
transmission was discontinued."</p></div>

than usual consternation. It was supposed to be of a more deadly type than that
of 1793. The medical profession was divided as to the treatment of the disease.
"Two hostile schools sprang up. At the head of one was William Currie.
Benjamin Rush led the other. The Currie men declared the fever was imported
and contagious. The Rush school maintained that it was not. Filthy streets,
they held, and loathsome alleys had much to do with the sickness, and they urged
the use of mercurial purges and the copious letting of blood."&mdash;<i>McMaster.</i></p></div>

</p><p>
"Some serious animadversions appear in the Connecticut Courant on the first
number of the <i>Book of Odes</i>, published in the Time-Piece of the 14th ult. being
a profane parody, as the writer insinuates, on the first Psalm of David&mdash;where
the <i>aristocrat</i> corresponds with the <i>saint</i> in the psalm, and the <i>democrat</i> with the
<i>impenitent sinner</i>. These gentlemen writers ought to consider that the parody in
question (as they choose to call it) was not meant to be sung through a deacon's

merely intended to be <i>harped</i> upon <i>out of doors</i>, for the benefit of all good democrats,
and the utter astoundment and confusion of <i>the contrary character</i>. In the
name of common sense how did the printers of the Connecticut Courant <i>dare</i> to
act so <i>irreverantly</i> as to place the parody before the psalm? Are they trampling
on all sanctity; or what do they mean? Let them beware&mdash;serious times are
coming on, gentlemen:

of 1815, the text of which I have used, though I have retained the title of the
newspaper version. In the 1815 edition the title is "The Heroine of the Revolution.
<i>To the men in power</i>," with the note "On December 23, 1797, Deborah
Gannet presented a petition to congress for a pension, in consideration of services
rendered during the whole of the American Revolutionary war, in the rank of a
common soldier in the regular armies of the United States. The above lines were
written on this occasion, at the request of the heroine. It is needless to say, she
had a competency bestowed on her during her natural life." Freneau's daughter
has thus recounted the circumstances under which the affair became known to the
poet:
</p><p>
"While editor of the <i>Time-Piece</i> his office was thronged with visitors mostly
wanting favors of one kind or another. One day he came into dinner and told
Mrs. Freneau that there had been rather an eccentric character in the office that
morning, telling him that she had served through the Revolutionary War in
man's attire and had received several wounds and showed the scars. All he
could do for her was to send her to Washington with a petition, which he did.
Her name was Deborah Gannet. She went to Congress, presented her petition,
and received her pension. Though he put not his name to it, it was immediately
known, as many of the members were his correspondents, also Thomas Jefferson,
the President."</p></div>

visited Washington in 1796, describes it as follows: "Having crossed an extensive
tract of level country somewhat resembling an English heath, I entered a large
wood through which a very imperfect road had been made, principally by removing
the trees or the upper parts of them in the usual manner. After some time
this indistinct way assumed more the appearance of a regular avenue, the trees
having been cut down in a straight line although no habitation of any kind was
visible. I had no doubt but I was now riding along one of the streets of the
metropolitan city. I continued in this spacious avenue for half a mile and then
came out upon a large spot cleared of wood, in the center of which I saw two
unfinished buildings and men at work on one of them. Advancing and speaking
to these workmen, they informed me that I was in the center of the city and that
the building was the Capitol. Looking from where I stood I saw on every side
a thick wood pierced with avenues in a more or less perfect state."</p></div>

<span class="i0">An Indian, who lived at Muskingum, remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was teazed by a parson to join his dear flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw off his blanket and put on a coat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Indian long slighted an offer so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preferring to preaching his fishing and fowling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sermon to him was a heart full of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing but little superior to howling.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last by persuasion and constant harassing<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of heaven, one day, when the parson was speaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And painting the beautiful things of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The convert, who something substantial was seeking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up, and confessed he had doubts in the case.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said he, Master Minister, this place that you talk of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of things for the stomach, pray what has it got;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has it liquors in plenty?&mdash;If so I'll soon walk off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put myself down in the heavenly spot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You fool (said the preacher) no liquors are there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place I'm describing is most like our meeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good people, all singing, with preaching and prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They live upon these without eating or drinking.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the doors are all locked against folks that are wicked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, I am fearful, will never get there:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life of Repentance must purchase the ticket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And few of you, Indians, can buy it, I fear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell (said the Indian) I'm none of your mess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On victuals, so airy, I faintish should feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot consent to be lodged in a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where's there's nothing to eat and but little to steal.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such music only will excite his rage,<br /></span>

<i>Time-Piece</i> in New York in 1798, and his final farewell to the sea, which was, in
reality, in 1807. During this time Freneau lived in retirement at Mount Pleasant,
making now and then voyages along the southern coast and to the Madeira
Islands. The poems of the period dwell largely on the dangers of monarchy.
He became more and more philosophical as he grew older. He delighted in his
leisure hours to translate from the old Latin writers, and to make moralizing
verses of a somewhat tedious nature. I have omitted all of the translations of
this period and most of the moralizings.</p></div>

was full of rumors of a French invasion. Talleyrand was scattering obscure hints
that an invading army was preparing; that France well knew that America
was divided; that only the Federalists would support the administration. The
Federalists, supported by President Adams and by Washington, took active
measures at once. In July they formally abrogated the treaty between the two
countries and authorized the President to grant letters to shipmen empowering
them to seize French vessels. The army was put into readiness, and financial
legislation was enacted to procure means for carrying on the war. All believed
that war with France was inevitable.</p></div>

destroyed by fire March 6, 1802. The damage was promptly repaired by generous
contributions from the alumni and friends of the institution. President
Smith took an active part in the work of rebuilding and it was in no small measure
due to his efforts that the edifice was so quickly restored.
</p><p>
Nassau Hall, the oldest and because of its historical associations the most
interesting of the Princeton buildings, was erected in 1756 from plans drawn by
Robert Smith and Dr. Shippen of Philadelphia. It was for many years the
handsomest and most commodious academic structure in the colonies and as such
attracted no little attention. During the Revolution it served repeatedly as
barracks and hospital for both armies and suffered considerable damage. From
the 26th of June until the 4th of November, 1783, it was the national capitol.
Within its walls the Congress of the nation found a safe retreat and for more than
four months held quiet session in the spacious library-room remote from the mutinous
troops at Philadelphia. Here the Minister from the States General of Holland,
the first ambassador accredited to America after the declaration of peace was
received, and here the grateful acknowledgments of Congress were tendered
Washington for his services in establishing the freedom and independence of the
United States.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">General Note.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the best accounts that could be procured at Madeira, there perished in
and near the city of Funchal, five hundred and fifty persons. The ravages were
chiefly confined to the eastern parts of the town where the loss was immense in
bridges, houses, streets and other property, public as well as private&mdash;there was
one magnificent church totally destroyed, standing near the sea, and called in the
portuguese tongue, Nossa Senyora da Caillou (lady of the beach) besides this,
there were five handsome chapels carried away. Five very considerable streets
with their immense stone buildings have entirely disappeared, or but some insignificant
parts remaining. The water rose in a short space of time from 14 to 16
feet in the adjacent parts of the city, and bursting into the buildings, where it did
not much injure the latter, it greatly damaged the merchantile property lodged
therein. There were about two hundred persons supposed to be lost in other
parts of the island, particularly in the villages, and small towns. The following
circumstance it was asserted, added not a little to the devastations occasioned by the
accumulation of water in the vallies. The governor, with several other considerable
landholders in the mountains, had, for several years back, been in the practice of
erecting stone dams across the vast and spacious valley above the city, at different
intervals of distance for the purpose of watering the adjacent grounds, or leading
off streams in a variety of directions&mdash;when the immense body of rain fell in October
last, all this gave way, and carried death and destruction therewith.&mdash;<i>Freneau's
note.</i></p></div>

the knight was under such serious apprehensions of being blown up by the Torpedo
men, that he enjoyed no sleep or rest for many nights together. With such
feelings, and under such impressions, he is supposed to begin his soliloquy abruptly,
under all the emotions of horror, incident to such an occasion.&mdash;<i>Freneau's note.</i>

Sir Thomas Hardy was commander of the 74 gun ship <i>Ramillies</i>, the leader
of the squadron which lay off New London during the summer of 1814. The following
in <i>Niles' Register</i>, May 7, 1814, is suggestive: "It appears the British
squadron off <i>New London</i> are yet disturbed by torpedoes. One of them lately
exploded under the sprit-sail yard of the <i>La Hoque</i>, and threw up a volume of
water near her fore top. The enemy, it seems, has a list of the persons concerned
in the management of these machines!"</p></div>

and thereupon determined to remove the seat of the war to the Niagara frontier.
The American expedition intended to invade Canada was directed, under command
of General Jacob Brown, to dislodge the British from this position. The first decisive
action was the battle of Chippewa, fought July 5, 1814, on Canadian soil,
opposite Niagara Falls. Three weeks later, July 25, he again closed with the
British at Bridgewater, or Lundy Lane, in the same vicinity. In both engagements
the Americans were victorious.</p></div>

<p>It has been found necessary for various reasons to omit some of the
poems that appear in the various editions of Freneau. For the most
part this omitted material has no historic or poetic significance. Nothing
would be gained by resurrecting it. It is only just to the poet, however,
to state that aside from a single piece, nothing has been omitted on
account of coarseness alone. In each case the earliest known title is
given in the list that follows. When a title was significantly changed
in later editions, the variation has been given in a foot note, with date
of edition.</p></div>

Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
