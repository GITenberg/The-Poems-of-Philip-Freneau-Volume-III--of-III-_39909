king of England, who seduced and took into keeping a sister of their society,
is reverenced and supported with repeated testimonies, while the friendly

"Early in June, the French fleet of thirty-one ships of the line, yielding
to Spanish importunities, put to sea from Brest; and yet they were obliged to
wait off the coast of Spain for the Spaniards. After a loss of two months in the
best season of the year, a junction was effected with more than twenty ships of
war under the command of ... Count Gaston; and the combined fleet, the
largest force that had ever been afloat, sailed for the British Channel.... The
united fleet rode unmolested by the British.... On the 16th of August
they appeared off Plymouth, but did not attack the town. After two idle days
a strong wind drove them to the west; when the gale had abated, the allies
rallied, returned up the channel, and the British retreated before them. No
harmony existed between the French and Spanish officers. A deadly malady
ravaged the French ships and infected the Spanish. The combined fleet never
had one chief. The French returned to port and remained there; the Spaniards
sailed for Cadiz, execrating their allies."&mdash;<i>Bancroft.</i></p></div>

<span class="i0">Which outward bound, to St. Eustatia's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death and disaster through the billows bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From Philadelphia's crowded port she came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there the builder plann'd her lofty frame,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wond'rous skill, and excellence of art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He form'd, dispos'd, and order'd every part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy beheld the stately fabric rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a stout bulwark of stupendous size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till launch'd at last, capacious of the freight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left her to the Pilots, and her fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">First from her depths the tapering masts ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By shrouds and stays secur'd from side to side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trees grew on trees, suspended o'er the tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm to the yards extended, broad and vast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hung the sails susceptive of the blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice ten six pounders at their port holes plac'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rang'd in rows, stood hostile in the waist:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all prepar'd, impatient for the seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She left her station with an adverse breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This her first outset from her native shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seas a stranger, and untry'd before.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the bright radiance that his glories spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere from the east gay Ph&#339;bus lifts his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sweet morn, a kindred name she won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aurora</i> call'd, the offspring of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose form projecting, the broad prow displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far glittering o'er the wave, a mimic blaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The gay ship now, in all her pomp and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sails expanded, flew along the tide;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware, that bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pile intended for a southern shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fruits, gay blossoms, and enamell'd plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sloping lawns the roving swain invite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sky-topt mountains teem with golden springs.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From Cape Henlopen, urg'd by favouring gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When morn emerg'd, we sea-ward spread our sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then east-south-east explor'd the briny way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the wind, departing from the bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer seen the hoarse resounding strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hearts elate we hurried from the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Escap'd the dangers of that shelvy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sailors fatal, and for wrecks renown'd.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The gale increases as we stem the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last they sink beneath the rolling wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seems their summits, as they sink, to lave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abaft the beam the freshening breezes play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mists advancing to deform the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tempests rising o'er the splendid scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sea unruffled, and a heaven serene.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now Sol's bright lamp, the heav'n born source of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had pass'd the line of his meridian height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And westward hung&mdash;retreating from the view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shores disappear'd, and every hill withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, still suspicious of some neighbouring foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft the Master bade a Seaman go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mark if, from the mast's aspiring height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the round a vessel came in sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Too soon the Seaman's glance, extending wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far distant in the east a ship espy'd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the wind was brac'd each shivering sail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her lee-guns lay delug'd in the waste:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her top-gallant flow'd an English Jack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her might she strove to gain our track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor strove in vain&mdash;with pride and power elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wing'd on by hell, she drove us to our fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stop no stay her bloody crew intends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So flies a comet with its host of fiends)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor oaths, nor prayers arrest her swift career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death in her front, and ruin in her rear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Struck at the sight, the Master gave command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change our course, and steer toward the land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to the task the ready sailors run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the word was utter'd, half was done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from the south the fiercer breezes rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift from her foe alarm'd Aurora flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every sail extended to the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fled the unequal foe that chac'd behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along her decks dispos'd in close array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each at its port, the grim artillery lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon on the foe with brazen throat to roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, small their size, and narrow was their bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet faithful they their destin'd station keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guard the barque that wafts them o'er the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who now must bend to steer a homeward course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust her swiftness rather than her force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfit to combat with a powerful foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her decks too open, and her waist too low.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more emerging, distant landscapes rise;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the air the starry streamer plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every sail its various tribute pays:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain the land we bore the weighty blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the wish'd for cape appear'd at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the vext foe, impatient of delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepar'd for ruin, press'd upon her prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near, and more near, in aweful grandeur came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frigate <i>Iris</i>, not unknown to fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Iris</i> her name, but <i>Hancock</i> once she bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fram'd and completed on New Albion's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Manly lost, the swiftest of the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fly with wings of canvas o'er the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, while for combat some with zeal prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the heavens the Boatswain sent his prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"List, all ye powers that rule the skies and seas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shower down perdition on such thieves as these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fate, strike their hearts with terror and dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And sprinkle on their powder salt-sea spray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"May bursting cannon, while his aim he tries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Destroy the Gunner, and be-damn his eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The chief who awes the quarter-deck, may he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tripp'd from his stand, be tumbled in the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"May they who rule the round-top's giddy height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be canted headlong to perpetual night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"May fiends torment them on a leeward coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And help forsake them when they want it most&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From their wheel'd engines torn be every gun&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And now, to sum up every curse in one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"May latent flames, to save us, intervene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And hell-ward drive them from their magazine!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Frigate now had every sail unfurl'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fierce Pelides, eager to destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chac'd the proud Trojan to the gates of Troy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span class="i0">Swift o'er the waves while hostile they pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As swiftly from their fangs <i>Aurora</i> flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length Henlopen's cape we gain'd once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly strove to force the ship ashore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern fate forbade the barren shore to gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denial sad, and source of future pain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then the inspiring breezes ceas'd to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost were they all, and smooth the seas below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the broad cape becalm'd, our lifeless sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer swell'd their bosoms to the gales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, unable to pursue her way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumbling about, at her own guidance lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the helm its wonted influence lends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No oars assist us, and no breeze befriends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the foe, advancing from the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang'd her black cannon, pointed on our lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up she luff'd, and blaz'd her entrails dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing destruction, terror, death and fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vext at our fate, we prim'd a piece, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return'd the shot, to shew them we were men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull night at length her dusky pinions spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every hope to 'scape the foe was fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to thy cape, Henlopen, though we press'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We could not gain thy desert, dreary breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ruin'd trees beshroud thy barren shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mounds of sand half hid, or cover'd o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ruffian winds disturb thy summit bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet every hope and every wish was there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain we sought to reach the joyless strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate stood between, and barr'd us from the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All dead becalm'd, and helpless as we lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ebbing current forc'd us back to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While vengeful <i>Iris</i>, thirsting for our blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every flash a storm of ruin came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till our shock'd vessel shook through all her frame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad for revenge, our breasts with fury glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wreak returns of vengeance on the foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full at his hull our pointed guns we rais'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hull resounded as the cannon blaz'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through his main top-sail one a passage tore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sides re-echo'd to the dreadful roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate fires dispell'd the shades of night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how unequal was this daring fight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve pounders from the foe our sides did maul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while no power to save him intervenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bullet struck our captain of Marines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce, though he bid defiance to the foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt his death and ruin in the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong he fell, distracted with the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deck distain'd, and heart blood streaming round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another blast, as fatal in its aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wing'd by destruction, through our rigging came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, whistling tunes from hell upon its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouds, stays, and braces tore at once away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sails, blocks, and oars in scatter'd fragments fly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their softest language was&mdash;<i>submit, or die!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Repeated cries throughout the ship resound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now every bullet brought a different wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt wind and water, one assail'd the side,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas then the Master trembled for his crew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dead were past their pain, the living groan,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sad and distressful as the close of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er distant streams appears the dewy green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leafy trees on mountain tops are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they no groves nor grassy mountains tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark'd for a longer journey to the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Black as the clouds that shade St. Kilda's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild as the winds that round her mountains roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every post some surly vagrant stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pick'd from the British or the Irish bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some slave from Hesse, some hangman's son at least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sold and transported, like his brother beast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some miscreant Tory, puff'd with upstart pride,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their musquets ready to obey command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounds are their sport, as ruin is their aim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their dark souls compassion has no claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And discord only can their spirits please:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such were our tyrants here, and such were these.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ingratitude! no curse like thee is found<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This pierces deep, too deeply wounds the breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We help'd them naked, friendless, and distrest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bestow'd them buildings, privilege, and land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the change!&mdash;when angry Britain rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These thankless tribes became our fiercest foes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So many mischiefs in these hulks are found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on them all a poem to prolong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would swell too high the horrors of my song&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunger and thirst to work our woe combine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mouldy bread, and flesh of rotten swine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mangled carcase, and the batter'd brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor's poison, and the captain's cane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soldier's musquet, and the steward's debt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening shackle, and the noon-day threat.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That juice destructive to the pangs of care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Rome of old, nor Athens could prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gains the day for many a modern chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When cool reflection yields a faint relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That charm, whose virtue warms the world beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was by these tyrants to our use denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet they deign'd that healthy juice to lade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The putrid water felt its powerful aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when refus'd&mdash;to aggravate our pains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fevers rag'd and revel'd through our veins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout my frame I felt its deadly heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt my pulse with quicker motions beat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pallid hue o'er every face was spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unusual pains attack'd the fainting head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No physic here, no doctor to assist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name was enter'd on the sick man's list;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve wretches more the same dark symptoms took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these were enter'd on the doctor's book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loathsome <i>Hunter</i> was our destin'd place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Hunter</i>, to all hospitals disgrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soldiers sent to guard us on our road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyful we left the <i>Scorpion's</i> dire abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tears we shed for the remaining crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then curs'd the hulk, and from her sides withdrew.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_42" id="Footnote_26_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_42"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> First published in Philadelphia, by Francis Bailey, in 1781. Freneau
wrote the poem during the summer of 1780, immediately after his exchange.
The original manuscript is in the possession of Miss Adele M. Sweeney, a
great-granddaughter of the poet. The text follows the edition of 1786.
</p><p>
On May 25, 1780, Freneau, in the ship <i>Aurora</i>, started from Philadelphia
as a passenger for Santa Cruz. The next day, while off Cape Henlopen,
the ship was captured by the British frigate <i>Iris</i>, Capt. Hawkes, and the crew
and passengers sent to New York as prisoners. For Freneau's account of his
capture and captivity, see <i>Some Account of the Capture of the Ship Aurora</i>,
1899.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_43" id="Footnote_27_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_43"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Freneau was placed on board the <i>Scorpion</i>, June 1, and was exchanged
July 12, 1780.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_44" id="Footnote_28_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_44"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> "The weather was very stormy and the river uncommonly rough. The
ship rolled considerably, and the water gushed into some of the lower ports,
which made some of the landsmen who slept in the cable tier imagine she was
sinking. In a moment the alarm became general.  'The ship is sinking! the ship
is sinking!' was echoed fore and aft. I expected every moment to feel myself
afloat in the berth where I lay; but at the same time considering it would be a
folly to drown between decks when I perhaps might get on shore somehow, I
jumped up and hurried toward the main hatchway, where a multitude was
endeavouring to get out; the sentries at the same time beating on their heads
with their drawn swords and marquets without mercy.... Some lamented that
they should never see their wives and children again; others begged by the
love of God to be let upon deck and they would bind themselves slaves forever
on board a man-of-war, or any other service.... After some trouble we got a
light, and examining the pump-well, found the ship dry and tight."&mdash;<i>Freneau's
Journal.</i></p></div>

who abused us continually. It is impossible for words to give his
character; it seemed as though he could not give any of us a civil word upon
the most indifferent occasion. When he was not cursing us, he kept in his
cabin in gloomy reserve, the most vile and detestable of mortals."&mdash;<i>Freneau's

of nearly three hundred of us. The best lodgings I could procure this night
was on a chest, almost suffocated with the heat and stench. I expected to die
before morning, but human nature can bear more than one would at first
suppose."&mdash;<i>Freneau's Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_48" id="Footnote_31_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_48"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> "The <i>Hunter</i> had been very newly put to the use of a hospital-ship.
She was miserably dirty and cluttered. Her decks leaked to such a degree that
the sick were deluged with every shower of rain. Between decks they lay
along struggling in the agonies of death; dying with putrid and bilious
fevers; lamenting their hard fate to die at such a fatal distance from their
friends; others totally insensible, and yielding their last breath in all the
horrors of light-headed frenzy.... Our allowance in the <i>Hunter</i>, to those
upon full diet, was one pound of bread and one pound of fresh beef per diem;
to those upon half diet, one pound of bread and one-half pound of beef
or mutton per diem. Every other day we had a cask of spruce beer sent
on board. Our fresh meat was generally heads or shanks, and would just
answer to make soup."&mdash;<i>Freneau's Journal.</i></p></div>

such remedies as were thought proper. Thus things went on, two or
three dying every day, who were carried on shore and buried in the bank, till
three of our crew, who had got pretty hearty, stole the boat one night and
made their escape. This occasioned new trouble. The doctor refused to
come on board, and as he rowed past us next morning to see somebody in the
<i>Jersey</i>, which lay near us, some of the sick calling to him for blisters, he told
them to put tar on their backs, which would serve as well as anything, and so
rowed away. However, after two or three days his wrath was appeased, and he
deigned to come on board again."&mdash;<i>Freneau's Journal.</i></p></div>

<p class="cblockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>West Point Fort.</i> Jeffery <i>and</i> Pasquin, <i>servants to</i> <span class="smcap">Arnold</span>,
<i>working in a garden</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> (<i>Throwing down his spade</i>) Faith, Jeffery, I
am weary of toiling among these rocks and precipices.
I must e'en give o'er. Our master should have fetched
his soil along with him to these savage retreats. We
may work till we are gray-headed ere we can produce a
turnip or a cabbage for him on these barren, unthrifty
rocks.</p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i> Be not discouraged, Pasquin, we shall have
better soil to work in ere long.</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> How know you that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i> I overheard my master t'other day telling a
friend of his, whom, by the by, the people of this country
call a Tory, that he had planned matters so that in a
little time the war would be over, and then he would
purchase one of the most fertile tracts of land in America
and entitle it a Manor; that he would settle the
same goodly possession with tenants and vassals, and
so being master among them, spend the remainder of
his days in quiet.</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> I pray for the speedy fulfilling of this design.
Our master, I know, is an able general. Why, I suppose
he intends to rout the enemy out of New York,
retake Charleston, conquer the warships of Britain, kill
the king, and so force the English nation to make peace
with the Americans.</p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i>  Heaven only knows in what manner he intends
to act or what his plan may be, but this I am sure of, he
keeps it very secret, and I believe there are not above
one or two of his friends that know anything of it.</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> Well, the sooner he gets a new garden for
us the better. I have worn out a dozen mattocks and
as many spades on these cursed craggy rocks. One's
tools to work here should be made of adamant. But,
Jeffery, do you not observe how gracious and intimate
our master has been for these several months past with
some who are called disaffected?</p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i> I have had it in my mind to make the same
observation to you, and do you not perceive that their
intimacy daily increases?</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> And then, when our master is at table with
some of these chosen favorites, how he sneers and hints
ludicrous things against the American officers and
army. One would think he heartily despised them, by
his behaviour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i> And what was it he said of the French the
other day? Did he not say they were a perfidious
nation of knaves, a herd of needy scoundrels who were
endeavoring to conquer this country from the king of
Britain, that they might add it to their own dominions
and make the people here slaves?</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> And when the general gives a dance or an
entertainment or a ball, we see none of the true-heart
Americans invited. His guests are a lukewarm, half-disaffected
sort of people, who say more than for their
own sakes I would choose to mention to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Jeff.</i> Well, this may all be true, and yet I cannot
help thinking our master is a hearty friend to his country.
He does these things for a feint, under a mask, as
it were, to find out secrets from the enemy. In good
faith, I am of opinion he will shortly drive every
British soldier off the continent and then become possessed
of his Lordship or Manor, or what-so you call it.</p>

<p><i>Pasq.</i> Amen, I say, and so let us work on in hopes
of better times.</p>

<p class="cblockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene II.&mdash;Major Andr&eacute;, Lucinda.</span> <i>Parlor.</i></p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> I cannot leave this city, sweet Lucinda,
without imparting to you that I am going a little
way toward the American lines, at the request of his
Excellency, upon some business of importance. I am
come to chat a little with you ere I go. It may be
some days before you see me again.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> If it be not too great a presumption in
me, my dear Major, I would beg to know whether you
depart on a peaceable or hostile errand. You must
pardon a woman's curiosity. I had a frightful dream
about you a few nights ago, which I cannot banish
from my mind ever since.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> I am happy, madam, in being the subject
of your dreams. But dreams are delusions of the
mind, mere vagaries and whimsies not to be attended
to. You may remember that, prior to our Charlestown
expedition, you discouraged me a good deal with
a vision you had of a vessel shipwrecked, and myself
with the other passengers drowned, and yet little or
nothing was intimated thereby. We made our passage
safe, conquered the place, and returned with victory
and honor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> True. But your fleet endured a terrible
hurricane, in which many perished.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> O Lucinda, thou art a dreamer of
dreams, thou thinkest, love.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> This last was represented to my mind in
quite a different manner, in such lively colours that I
cannot help thinking some evil is foreboded to you.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Poh! Let's hear the extraordinary
dream, then, that we may laugh a little at it.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> I imagined myself in a country where the
skies were forever cloudy and gloomy, with frequent
bursts of thunder and flashes of lightning. Among
many other objects, all of which seemed disconsolate
and melancholy, I saw you endeavouring to reach the
summit of a sharp, craggy precipice. You leaped with
surprising agility over dark gulfs and apertures therein,
which no other man would have thought of passing.
The spectators admired your activity and daring spirit.
The continual obstacles in your way seemed nothing to
you, and at length you bid fair to gain the summit,
when, catching hold of a shrub, which was but slightly
rooted in one of the crevices of the rock, it instantly
gave way, and you tumbled to the bottom, dashed to
pieces on the pointed crags and torn in a shocking
manner. I shrieked out and waked.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Your dream was frightful indeed; but
still it was nothing but a dream. Why, I have imagined
before now in my sleep that I have tumbled down
ten thousand fathoms in a perpendicular line; but all
this was owing to mere mechanical causes, the motion
of the animal spirits or the veins being rather too
replete with blood.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> Well, be it so. I hope my dream may
be the forerunner of no mischief. But are you going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
out on a fighting expedition, sir, if I may be so bold to
ask the question?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> My dearest love, I will conceal nothing
from you. I know you are the girl of a thousand
for keeping a secret. It must not take air. I have
corrupted General Arnold. He is to sell West Point
fort to me, and this evening I am to set out and consult
with him upon the fittest means to blind the eyes of the
Samson and deliver up the place to Sir Henry without
danger of failure.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> But could not some person be deputized
for this purpose whose life is not of such value to
Britain as yours? You are a proud soul to Sir Henry
Clinton. He enterprises nothing without first having
your advice and direction. If you should be intercepted
in your way by the Americans, would it not
endanger your life, my dear Andr&eacute;, to be found without
some mission or any plausible excuse for being
within an enemy's lines?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> You are too timorous, Lucinda. I
shall go and come by water in an armed ship. I may
perhaps just venture on shore in a &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_34_51" id="FNanchor_34_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_51" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of time, but
shall take care not to expose myself to any danger. I
well know how far to venture, but if the worst come to
the worst, I can tell them I have deserted from the
British. Then I shall be caressed among them till
such times as I can find an opportunity to escape and
join my countrymen.</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> You venture all this, you say, at the
request of Sir Henry?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Yes; but chiefly to serve my country.
Had I a thousand lives, I would lay them all down for
Britain and my king. But I must go. You deject my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
spirits, my girl. A woman is destructive to the spirit
of enterprise in a man. Poh! I am growing melancholy
too. You must cheer my drooping soul, Lucinda.
I heard you humming a little song the other day. Do
let's have it. I think it begins thus: "My native
shades delight no more."</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> Although I am in no humour for music,
you shall hear it, my love. I suppose it was made by
some British officer on his setting out for America,
who was as great an idolater to his king and country as
most English gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> You sing charmingly, Lucinda. The
poor fellow's resolution pleases me. He engages to
give his life, if necessary, for his king and country, and
yet perhaps he feels the ingratitude of both every hour
in the day. It must, however, be so. Nature has
formed us with a principle of love to our native land.
What say you, Lucinda?</p>

<p><i>Lucinda.</i> It may be so, sir; and yet that love need
not carry us to such an idolatrous extravagance as is
manifested in the little stanzas I had the pleasure of
singing to you.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Indeed you are in the right, but we

<p class="ralign">[<i>Enter Pasquin</i></p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> Sir, there is a traveller just alighted at
Sergeant Jones's quarters, who desires to know whether
he can have a little private conference with you, and
asked me whether you were alone or no.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> A traveller? How is he dressed?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> He has on a plain suit of blue clothes, a
cocked beaver hat and draw boots. He rides a common
bay horse, and by his general appearance one would
suppose him to be a commissary, or perhaps a quarter-master.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> How came you to know all these particulars;
the night being so dark and stormy?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> I had a glimpse of him by means of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
lanthorn we carried out when he got off his horse.
Over all, I forgot to mention, he had a fear-naught
riding coat.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> A plain blue suit, you say?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> And draw boots?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> And wore he sword?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> No; he had no sword, that I saw.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> And what aspect is he? Is he a well-looking
man?</p>

<p><i>Pasquin.</i> As handsome a man, please your honour,
as ever the sun shone upon. It did me good to look
upon him.</p>

<p><i>Arnold</i> (<i>aside</i>). This must be him. [<i>To Pasquin</i>]

Bid the sergeant show him the way to me immediately,
and put up his horse in my own stable. He is from
Philadelphia, a friend and relative of mine.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit Pasquin</i></p>

<p><i>Arnold</i> (<i>solus</i>). This is Major Andr&eacute;, indeed. We
have agreed in our correspondence that he shall pass
here under the name of Captain Ashton, to prevent
suspicion.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Sergeant introduces Major Andr&eacute;</i></p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> Captain Ashton, my friend, how are you?
Please to draw near the fire and sit. How do our
friends at Philadelphia? [<i>Exit sergeant</i>] The booby
is now gone, and we may talk freely without suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> I am happy at length to see General
Arnold, with whom I have corresponded so long at a
distance. I hope, my dear general, you are ready to
perform your promise.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> Undoubtedly the fort shall be yours within
three days, upon the conditions I mentioned to you in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
my last letter. I hope you have apprised Sir Henry
of them.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Yes, sir. He is satisfied, and thinks
your demand really moderate; but now let us to the
point. We must fall upon some plan by which we
must act without much danger of miscarriage. Would
it not be best that our troops should seem to take the
fort by surprise, and thus prevent the world from
having any suspicion of treachery in the case?</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> I have had the same thought, my dear sir.
Besides, if we can make this pass, I shall become a
prisoner of war to you in appearance, be exchanged
after a little time, and so be in a capacity to serve you
again; or, pretending the fort not tenable, I may make
my escape during your attack, and all this without any
suspicion on the part of the Americans.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> God grant your scheme may be successful.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> Now hear what I have to propose further.
When you are embarked with your army, suppose one
or two thousand men or more sail up the river as far as
you safely can, short of the fort, and endeavour to make
the country believe you are on a plundering expedition.
I shall have companies out who will give me notice of
all your movements. Then land your men, march up to
the fort, demand a surrender, which I will absolutely
refuse. Upon which hang out your bloody flag and fire
against the walls point blank, without mercy. In that
part of the fortress where I shall be, you will see a
small white flag flying. Do not fire to that quarter.
The garrison shall discharge the artillery three times
over your heads, after which I will surrender and open
the gates to you. Then, by not putting one of the
garrison to death, which would be your right, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
having stormed it, you will have an excellent opportunity
of giving the world a new instance of British
humanity. Then you may pour your troops into the
fort, take possession of it, and hoist the British flag.
The prisoners may immediately be sent to the shipping
and ordered to New York before the Continental forces
will have a chance of hindering the embarkation. What
say you?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Excellently well imagined. I hope it
may succeed. The money shall be paid you on your
arrival at York; but there is another service Sir Henry
would fain hope you could indulge him in, and your
reward shall be double.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> What may it be?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> He is eager to be possessed of your
Commander-in-Chief. Could you contrive no way to
get him into our hands? He is the soul of this obstinate
rebellion. Were he a prisoner to us, America
would soon be ours again.</p>

<p><i>Arnold</i> (<i>pausing</i>). Why, true, it would greatly facilitate
the recovery of the colonies. Let me see. I will
endeavour to prevail upon him to spend a day or two at
Robinson's home. Nay, I am sure he will be here next
Monday, and the garrison. There are a number of disaffected
people not far from hence, whom I can engage
to secure his person and convey him on board the <i>Vulture</i>
ship of war.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> If we become by your means possessed
of these two jewels, General Washington and
this important fort, we shall never think the obligation
sufficiently acknowledged. You will become the greatest
man in the world. Britain will adore you. She
will kiss the very ground you tread upon, besides lavishing
wealth upon you by millions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> She is heartily welcome to such poor services
as I can render her. What I do is from principle,
from the consciousness of a rectitude of heart and love
to my country.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Sir, you were born to be a great man.
Now, if you will be pleased to deliver me the plan of the
fort, signals of recognizance and other papers of consequence
in this affair, I will be going. I do not think
myself safe till such times as I get within the British
lines again.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> The danger is trifling. With a passport
from me, you may go anywhere in these colonies.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> Sir, I thank you. It may be of service
indeed.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> I will write it immediately. There, sir;
and here is the packet. I will not detain you, because
I know the business requires dispatch. You will, however,
sup with me, and take a glass of wine before
you go.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> I shall hardly have time; however, I
will wait half an hour.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> Walk with me into this other apartment;
we soldiers do not stand upon ceremony. But how do
you carry these papers so as to conceal them in case
you meet with any over-curious persons?</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> I have an expedient. I can carry
them in the foot of my boot. Do you see how snug
they lie?</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Putting them on</i></p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> Aye, faith, that was well thought of; but
do not put the passport in your boot.</p>

<p><i>Maj. Andr&eacute;.</i> No, no. That goes into my pocket.</p>

Freneau, judging from indications, wrote it shortly after his "Prison Ship,"
in the autumn of 1780, only a few weeks after the events took place which
it records. It exists, as far as I know, only in Freneau's fragmentary and

Sweeney of Jersey City. The arrest of Andr&eacute; took place September 23, 1780.</p></div>

with Mr. Francis Bailey's <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, in Philadelphia. In June, 1784,
he left Philadelphia for a wandering career upon the ocean, which continued

early part of 1781 working his way steadily northward from South Carolina.
Benedict Arnold arrived in the Chesapeake, January 2, 1781, and, supported
by the British navy there, committed extensive ravages on the rivers and
unprotected coasts of Virginia. Arnold offered to spare Richmond if he were
given its stores of tobacco. The offer being rejected, the city with its tobacco
was burned.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_71" id="Footnote_53_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_71"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The American frigate <i>Trumbull</i>, 20, Captain James Nicholson, was
chased off the capes of the Delaware, August 8th, 1781, by three British
cruisers. As it was blowing heavily towards night, the fore-topmast of the
<i>Trumbull</i> was carried away by a squall, bringing down with it, on deck, the
main-topgallant mast. About ten o'clock at night, one of the British vessels,
the <i>Iris</i>, 32, came up and closed with her while still encumbered with the
wreck. "In the midst of rain and squalls, in a tempestuous night, with most
of the forward hamper of the ship over her bows, or lying on the forecastle,
with one of the arms of the fore-topsail yard run through her fore-sail, and the
other jammed on deck, and with a disorganized crew, Captain Nicholson found
himself compelled to go to quarters, or to strike without resistance. He preferred
the first; but the English volunteers, instead of obeying orders, went
below, extinguished the lights, and secreted themselves. Near half of the
remainder of the people imitated this example, and Captain Nicholson could
not muster fifty of even the diminished crew he had, at the guns. The battle
that followed might almost be said to have been fought by the officers. These
brave men, sustained by a party of the petty officers and seamen, managed a
few of the guns for more than an hour, when the <i>General Monk</i>, 18, coming
up and joining in the fire of the <i>Iris</i>, the <i>Trumbull</i> submitted."&mdash;<i>Cooper's
Naval History.</i>&mdash;[<i>Duyckinck's note, ed. of 1865.</i>]</p></div>

value of three million pounds sterling."</p></div>

Lord Dunmore was Governor of Virginia at the beginning of the war,
in 1775, and was driven from that State by the outraged colonists. He continued
in America, in various capacities, until near the close of the war. Lord
George Germaine was Colonial Secretary under George III., and so had

had written to Cornwallis: "The rapidity of your movements is justly matter

houses, ravaged estates, and put to death whom they would.... For two

patriot army under Greene spent the summer of 1781 in the High Hills of
Santee, in South Carolina. "On the 22d of August, Greene broke up his
camp very quietly and started out on the last of his sagacious campaigns....
By vigilant scouting parties, he so completely cut off the enemy's means of
information that Stuart remained ignorant of his approach until he was close
at hand. The British commander then fell back on Eutaw Springs, about fifty
miles from Charleston, where he waited in a strong position. The battle of
Eutaw Springs may be resolved into two brief actions between sunrise and
noon of the 8th of September, 1781. In the first action the British line was
broken and driven from the field. In the second, Stuart succeeded in forming
a new line, supported by a brick house and palisaded garden, and from this
position Greene was unable to drive him. It has therefore been set down as a
British victory. If so, it was a victory followed the next evening by the hasty
retreat of the victors, who were hotly pursued by Marion and Lee."&mdash;<i>Fiske.</i></p></div>

introduction: "On Wednesday evening, the 2d instant [January 2,
1782] Alex. Quesnay, Esq., exhibited a most elegant entertainment at the playhouse,
where were present his excellency Gen. Washington, the Minister of
France, the President of the State, a number of officers of the army, and a
brilliant assemblage of ladies and gentlemen of the city who were invited.
After a prologue suitable to the occasion, <span class="smcap">Eugenie</span>, an elegant French comedy,
was first presented (written by the celebrated M. Beaumarchais), and in the
opinion of several good judges was extremely well acted by the young gentlemen
students in that polite language. After the comedy was acted the <span class="smcap">Lying
Varlet</span>, a farce; to this succeeded several curious dances, followed by a brilliant
illumination, consisting of thirteen pyramidal pillars, representing the thirteen
States,&mdash;on the middle column was seen a cupid, supporting a laurel crown
over the motto, '<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>the pride of his Country and terror of Britain</i>.'
On the summit was the word <i>Virginia</i>, on the right <i>Connecticut</i>, with the
names <span class="smcap">Greene</span> and <span class="smcap">La Fayette</span>, on the left the word <i>Pennsylvania</i>, with the
names <span class="smcap">Wayne</span> and <span class="smcap">Steuben</span>, and so on according to the birthplace and State
proper to each general. The spectacle ended with an artificial illumination of
the thirteen columns."
</p><p>
The prologue, written at the request of Mr. Quesnay, is as above.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_121_144" id="Footnote_121_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_144"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> In the 1786 version, which was reprinted verbatim from the newspaper,
this read "Great Sir," with the foot-note, "Addressed to His Excellency
General Washington," and the rest of the poem was made to refer solely to
him. In the later versions this was changed so as to read, "Addressed to the
Commander in Chief and several of the officers of the American army then
present at the theatre in Southwark."</p></div>

Henry, third son of George III, afterwards William IV, entered the navy
as midshipman at the age of fourteen in 1779. He sailed in the <i>Prince George</i>
of 98 guns to Gibralter, in the course of which cruise he saw some service
under Rodney in conflict with the Spanish fleet; and it was in this ship, accompanied
by Admiral Digby, that he arrived at New York in September, 1781."&mdash;<i>Duyckinck.</i>
He was received with great enthusiasm and ceremony. In the
<i>Freeman's Journal</i> of January 25, 1782, was the following, doubtless from the
pen of Freneau: "It is observable that the arrival of Prince William Henry in
New York filled the British with 'joy ineffable and universal.' The very chimney
sweeps, smitten with the poetic flame, composed odes in his praise, some
of which were inserted in <i>The Royal Gazette</i>." The 1809 edition was given a
long French motto from Mirabeau, which Freneau translates as follows:
"The favourites of a throne bask in its sunshine, like butterflies in a fine day.
Their very slaves at the foot of royalty partake of the delusion. They keep a
nation under their feet, and their every folly influences and is followed by the
multitude. They care not if their fathers and their nearest relatives are
trampled into the dust, provided <i>they</i> can figure away in the circles of a court,
etc."</p></div>

James Rivington, an Englishman, was a bookseller and printer in New
York from 1761 until the close of the Revolution. In 1773 he published the
first number of <i>The New York Gazetteer, or the Connecticut, New Jersey,
Hudson's River and Quebec Weekly Advertiser</i>. At the opening of the war he
became a violent British partisan. His office was destroyed by the Whigs in
1775. Two years later he established <i>Rivington's New York Loyal Gazette</i>,
which became the official British newspaper in America. On December 13 of
the same year, he changed the name to the <i>Royal Gazette</i>. In the last years of
the Revolution, when British success seemed more and more uncertain, Rivington
began to lean toward the Whig side, but he was never trusted by the
patriots, and he passed his last years in loneliness and poverty.</p></div>

introduction:</p>

<p>"Mr. Printer: The people of England at this time seem persuaded or
rather deluded into the opinion that the American revolt will be quashed in the
year 1786, and under that idea it is likely will prosecute the war with vigour for
some time to come. This infatuation chiefly owes its birth to a prophecy of
one John Cosins, who lived in the reign of the Second Charles, importing that
a certain transatlantic insurrection, and the Kirk of Scotland, will both fall to
the ground in the year above mentioned. Cosins's predictions are as follows,
taken from the <i>Royal Gazette</i> of the 18th ult.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When a branch of the thistle gets over the Atlantic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a new world the root shall be planted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it doth arrive at a degree of perfection<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It surely will breed a great insurrection.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the year seventy and four the root will be polished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in eighty and six it will be quite abolished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lily and the thistle in that year will unite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lion and the dun cow will put them to flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eagle will eagerly join in the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But luna will clip both their wings in a day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thistle, O thistle, thy wounds will be sore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kirk and kirk government will be no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you'll be abridg'd of all civil power.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To show that America has not been wholly destitute of oracular sages in
past times, I send you the following choice words or prophetical hints of an
illiterate fisherman, who died about thirty years ago at his habitation, a few
miles above the mouth of the Susquehanna. I discovered the paper containing
them by mere accident in tumbling over the leaves of an old book at an inn
near that place. If you think the lines worth inserting in your paper, they are
at your service."</p>

<p>Reprinted without change in the edition of 1786, the text of which I have
followed above. In later editions the prophecy was changed somewhat to
conform to historical facts.</p></div>

candid person will certainly <i>draw a line between a brave and magnanimous
people, and a most vicious and vitiating government</i>. Perhaps the following
extract from a pamphlet lately published in London and republished at
Baltimore (June, 1809) by Mr. <i>Bernard Dornin</i>, will place the preceding sentiment
in a fair point of view:
</p><p>
"A better spirit than exists in the English people, never existed in any
people in the world; it has been misdirected, and squandered upon party purposes
in the most degrading and scandalous manner; they have been led to
believe that they were benefiting the commerce of England by destroying the
commerce of America, that they were defending their sovereign by perpetuating
the bigoted oppression of their fellow subjects; their rulers and their
guides have told them that they would equal the vigour of France by equalling
her atrocity, and they have gone on, wasting that opulence, patience and
courage, which if husbanded by prudent, and moderate counsels, might have
proved the salvation of mankind. The same policy of turning the good qualities
of Englishmen to their own destruction, which made Mr. Pitt omnipotent,
continues his power to those who resemble him only in his vices; advantage is
taken of the loyalty of Englishmen, to make them meanly submissive; their
piety is turned into persecution; their courage into useless and obstinate contention;
they are plundered because they are ready to pay, and soothed into
assinine stupidity because they are full of virtuous patience. If England must
perish at last, so let it be: that event is in the hands of God; we must dry up
our tears, and submit. But that England should perish swindling and stealing;
that it should perish waging war against lazar-houses and hospitals; that
it should perish persecuting with monastic bigotry; that it should calmly give
itself up to be ruined by the flashy arrogance of one man, and the narrow
fanaticism of another: these events are within the power of human beings, but
I did not think that the magnanimity of Englishmen would ever stoop to such
degradations."&mdash;<i>Freneau's note.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_152_188" id="Footnote_152_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_188"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> First published in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, April 24, 1782. On April 10,
the Journal contained the following account of the battle:
</p><p>
"Yesterday the <i>Hyder Ally</i>, a vessel fitted out for the protection of this
river and its trade, returned to Chester after a severe conflict with a vessel of
superior force, which with great gallantry and good conduct on the part of
Capt. Barney and his crew, has been captured and brought into port. The
particulars of the action, as far as we have been able to collect them, are that
a fleet of merchantmen, having proceeded down the bay, were met by an
enemy's frigate of forty guns, with the <i>General Monk</i>, Sloop of War, and
<i>Fair American</i>, privateer; the <i>General Monk</i> having eighteen nine pounders
and one hundred and fifty men. The fleet endeavored to return, but were
pursued by the frigate, sloop, and privateer. The <i>Fair American</i> being
engaged with one of the fleet, and the frigate being at a considerable distance,
gave the <i>Hyder Ally</i> an opportunity to attack the <i>General Monk</i> singly, which
Capt. Barney embraced, and after a very close and brave attack of about thirty
minutes, the <i>General Monk</i> surrendered to her inferior adversary. The <i>General
Monk</i> had fifty-three men killed and wounded, among whom are most of the
officers; on board the <i>Hyder Ally</i> there were fifteen killed and wounded. A
brig, one of the fleet, was taken, and the <i>General Greene</i> left engaged with the
<i>Fair American</i>. The conduct of Capt. Barney has given the greatest satisfaction
and shows him truly worthy of the trust committed to him."</p></div>

Cornwallis, of the British fleet in the West Indies, over the squadron of Count
De Grasse."&mdash;<i>Freneau's note to 1809 edition.</i></p>

<p>On June 5, 1782, Freneau printed the following in the Journal:</p>

<p class="ralign">"Formidable, between Guadaloupe and Monpenat,<br />
April 14, 1782. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </p>

<p>"Sir: I am this moment favoured with your excellency's letter, and have the
happiness to acquaint you that after having had a partial engagement with the
enemy on the 9th, wherein 16 of my rear were prevented by calms from joining
in the action, on the 12th I had the good fortune to bring them to a
general action, which lasted from seven o'clock in the morning until half-past
six in the afternoon, without a moment's intermission. Count de Grasse, with
the <i>Ville de Paris</i> and four other ships of the line and one sunk, graced the
victory. The remainder of their fleet was so miserably shattered and their loss
of men so very great from their having their whole army consisting of 5,500
men on board the ships of war, that I am convinced it will be almost impossible
to put them in a condition for service for some considerable time.</p>

<p class="ralign">I am hastening with my whole fleet, etc.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;<br />
<span class="smcap">G. B. Rodney.</span>"</p>

<p>Freneau's early doubts as to this victory, which was loudly proclaimed in
the <i>Royal Gazette</i>, is evidenced not only by the poem, but by the following
comment on Rodney's letter:</p>

<p>"The unskilful forger of Sir George Rodney's letter, which is pretended
to have been wafted from Jamaica to Savannah and thence to Charleston,
exhibits Sir George not as a British admiral, but as a saucy upstart.... To
comment on this absurd forgery would be nugatory."</p>

<span class="i0">"<i>Le Cesar</i>, 'tis true, is a seventy-four,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"With a conquest like this, how bright we shall shine!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"He had taken them all, and he knew not but more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the partners broke up, as good friends as they met,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And said, There's no fear we shall die in our shoes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now let us give credit to Jemmy, forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since once in a way he has hit on the truth:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He hardly reflects where he'll go when he dies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But still, when he dies, let it never be said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he rests in his grave with no verse at his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But furnish, ye poets, some short epitaph,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something like this, that readers may laugh:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Here <i>lies</i> a King's Printer, we needn't say who:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There is reason to think that he tells what is true:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But if he <i>lies</i> here, 'tis not over-strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His present position is but a small change,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So, reader, pass on&mdash;'tis a folly to sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all his life long he did little but <i>lie</i>.<br /></span>

1782] at Crawford and Donaldson's insurance office in High street and, conversing
on the subject of the captures making in the bay by the <i>General

fit out a vessel which might succeed to capture her. The money was obtained
of the Bank of North America upon the responsibility of sundry individuals;
the <i>Hyder Ali</i> was purchased of John W. Stanley and the command given to
Capt. Barney; a crew of volunteers, chiefly from the regular service, was engaged,
and a commission of a letter of marque procured. In a week the vessel
was ready and sailed."&mdash;Watson's <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i>. The poem was

"They [the Scandinavians] imagined the chief pleasure of this immortality
would be to drink beer out of bowls made of the skulls of the enemies they had
slain in battle, according to the number of which every one was to be esteemed
and honored in the mansions of another world. Their war songs were particularly
horrible to the imagination, and full of those savage notions of valor and
romantic heroism that is to this day observable in the North American Indians....
Is it possible that a being illuminated by the rays of that spiritual sun
could in his senses write the following lines: they were composed (with a great
deal more) by one of the warrior chiefs of the Scandinavians more than 800
years since, a few hours before he expired?"</p></div>

following reprint of the proclamation taken from Rivington's <i>Royal Gazette</i> of
the 26th of June:
</p><p>
"By His Excellency Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">James Robertson</span>, <i>Governor of
New York, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i> The Commander-in-chief having shown the great confidence
he reposes in the Citizens of New York by trusting his Majesty's
interest there, to their Zeal, Loyalty, and Gallantry, I persuade myself that
every citizen will with alacrity claim his title to a share of the Militia duty; that
none may be deprived of this, and that those whose zeal would lead them to
appear whenever called for, may not be called for too often, I think proper to
declare:
</p><p>
"That all persons are to perform the Militia duty, excepting the Ministers
of God's Word, his Majesty's Counsellors and principal servants whose avocations
to religious and civil, necessarily prevents their attendance on Military
duties.
</p><p>
"All persons who from age or infirmity are unable to act, may do duty by
substitutes, providing those they offer are judged sufficient by the Colonel of
the regiment, or commanding officer of the corps to which they belong.
</p><p>
"If any of the Gentlemen of the learned professions find themselves so
usefully employed as to be induced to avoid the honour of appearing in person,
they are supposed to be judges of the importance of their own time, and may
act by proper substitutes.
</p><p>
"As no person deserves protection in a place of which he refuses to contribute
to the defence; every person who refuses to appear when summoned to
his Militia duty is to be confined in the Main-Guard by the Colonel or commanding
Officer of the corps to which he belongs, where he is to be kept till
further orders.

<span class="i1">Curs'd be the day, how bright soe'er it shin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That first made kings the masters of mankind;<br /></span>

note, "See the <i>Royal Gazette</i> of the 10th ult. and our last." The article in the

</p><p class="noidt">
"<i>To the Public:</i>
</p><p>
"The Publisher of this paper, sensible that his zeal for the success of his
Majesty's arms, his sanguine wishes for the good of his country and his friendship
for individuals, have at times led him to credit and circulate paragraphs
without investigating the facts so closely as his duty to the public demanded,
trusting to their feelings and depending on their generosity, he begs them to
look over past errors and depend on future correctness, for henceforth he will
neither desire nor expect nor solicit their favors longer than his endeavors shall
stamp the same degree of authenticity and credit on the <i>Royal Gazette</i> (of
N. Y.) as all Europe allow to the <i>Royal Gazette</i> of London."
</p><p>
The <i>Freeman's Journal</i> reprinted this on July 31, with the comment:
"From hence it is to be presumed that Satan, Rivington &amp; Co. have thoughts
of breaking up partnership." The text follows the edition of 1786.</p></div>

with the <i>Independent Gazetteer</i>, a paper which had been established in
Philadelphia on April 13, 1782, by Eleazer Oswald. To such extremes did
this quarrel go that Oswald, defeated by the more nimble pen of his adversary,
at length challenged him to a duel. The above poem marks the beginning of
the poetical phase of the battle. It appeared in the <i>Journal</i> on the 28th of
August and was a reply to the following effusion published in the <i>Gazetteer</i>
four days previously:

Joseph Reed, the "pale Joe" of the poem. So bitter and persistent
were the attacks of "Oswald's Scribblers" that Reed, in the <i>Journal</i> of Sept.
11, published a protest against the "set of men in this city [who] uninjured
and unprovoked by me are weekly pouring forth some abuse under anonymous
signatures." And early in 1783 he put forth a pamphlet entitled "Remarks
on a late publication in the <i>Independent Gazetteer</i>, with a short address to the
people of Pennsylvania on the many libels and slanders which have lately appeared
against the author." A second edition was called for several weeks
after the first issue of this pamphlet.</p></div>

Tammany was an Indian chieftain of the Lenni Lennape Confederacy of
New York and Pennsylvania during the early colonial era. There is a tradition
that he was the first Indian to welcome William Penn to America. Some
traditions locate his lodge near the present site of Princeton College and others
make him end his long life near a spring in Bucks county, Pa. He figures in
Cooper's novel, "The Last of the Mohicans."</p></div>

<span class="i0">If Carleton should sail for our dear native shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As Clinton, Cornwallis, and Howe did before)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take off the soldiers that serve for our guard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet still I surmise, for aught I can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Congress or Senates would meddle with me.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By all turning soldiers, and keeping the town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoe'er was the Tory that struck out the plan,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Good folks, do your will&mdash;but I vow and I swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll be boil'd into soup before I'll live there:<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><span class="i0">Great things were expected from Clinton and Howe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what have they done, or where are they now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Guy was sent over to kick up a dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who already prepares to return in disgust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The object delusive we wish to attain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been in our reach, and may be so again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so oddly does heaven its bounties dispense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has granted our king such a small share of sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, let Fortune favour or smile as she will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are doomed to drive on, like a horse in a mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though we may seem to advance on our rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but to return to where we sate out.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From hence I infer (by way of improvement)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nothing is got by this circular movement;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I plainly perceive, from this fatal delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are going to ruin the round-about way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some nations, like ships, give up to the gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are hurried ashore with a full flowing sail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Sweden submitted to absolute power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freemen were changed to be slaves in an hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Theodore soon from his grandeur came down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaking his subjects and Corsican crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we&mdash;'tis our fate, without ally or friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go to perdition, close hauled to the wind.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span><span class="i1">The case is too plain, that if I stay here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have something to hope and something to fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In regard to my carcase, I shouldn't mind that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can say "I have lived," and have grown very fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been in my day remarkable shifty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon, very soon, will be verging on fifty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis time for the state of the dead to prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis time to consider how things will go there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some few are admitted to Jupiter's hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the dungeons of Pluto are open to all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day is approaching as fast as it can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jemmy will be a mere moderate man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will sleep under ground both summer and winter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hulk of a man, and the shell of a printer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And care not a farthing for George, or his line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What empires start up, or what kingdoms decline.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our parson last Sunday brought tears from my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he told us of heaven, I thought of my lies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his flock he described it, and laid it before 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As if he had been in its <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recounted its beauties that never shall fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quoted John Bunyan to prove what he said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Debarred from the gate who the Truth should deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or "whosoe'er loveth or maketh a lie."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the course of my life it has still been my lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of myself, to say "things that are not."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore suspect that upon my decease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a poet will leave me to slumber in peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at least once a week be-scribble the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Jemmy, poor Jemmy, lies sleeping alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Howe'er in the long run these matters may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the scripture is true, it has bad news for me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, when I come to examine the text,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the learned annotations that Poole has annexed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span><span class="i0">Throughout the black list of the people that sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot once find that I'm mention'd therein;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoremongers, idolators, all are left out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wizards and dogs (which is proper, no doubt)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he who says, I'm there, mistakes or forgets&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It mentions no Printers of Royal Gazettes!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In truth, I have need of a mansion of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here to remain might suit me the best&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philadelphia in some things would answer as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Some Tories are there, and my papers might sell)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then I should live amongst wrangling and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be forced to say <i>credo</i> the rest of my life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their sudden conversion I'm much at a loss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am told that they bow to the wood of the cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worship the reliques transported from Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St. Peter's toe-nails, and St. Anthony's comb.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thus the true faith they no longer defend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarcely can think where the madness will end&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the greatest among them submit to the Pope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reason have I for indulgence to hope?<br /></span>

of the Huddy affair. I can do no better than to quote Freneau's own version
of the episode contributed to the <i>Journal</i> for June 12:
</p><p>
"Capt. Huddy, of the Jersey militia, was attacked in a small fort on
Tom's river, by a party of refugees in the British pay and service, was made
prisoner, together with his company, carried to New York, and lodged in the
provost of that city; about three weeks after which, he was taken out of the
provost down to the water side, put into a boat and brought again to the Jersey
shore, and there, contrary to the practice of all nations but savages, was
hung up on a tree [April 8, 1782] and left hanging until found by our people,
who took him down and buried him.
</p><p>
"The inhabitants of that part of the country where the murder was committed,
sent a deputation to general Washington, with a full and certified state
of the fact. Struck as every human breast must be, with such outrage, and
determined both to punish and prevent it for the future, the general represented
the case to general Clinton, who then commanded, and demanded that
the refugee officer who ordered and attended the execution, and whose name is
Lippencut, should be delivered up as a murderer, and in case of refusal that
the person of some British officer should suffer in his stead. The demand,
though not refused, has not been complied with, and the melancholy lot (not
by selection, but by casting lots) has fallen upon captain Asgil of the guards,
who, as I have already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to camp, a
martyr to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in, and the ingratitude
of those he has served."
</p><p>
Asgill was finally released.</p></div>

<p class="cblockquot">Addressed to those Gentlemen who have been pleased to favour<br />
<span class="smcap">Francis Wrigley</span>, News Carrier, with their custom</p>

<p class="cblockquot">January 1, 1783</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">According to custom, once more I appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the verse you expect at the dawn of the year:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For at length we have got into Eighty and Three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in spite of proud Britain, are happy and free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the times have been hard, and our commerce gone wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We still have been able to struggle along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If some, through misfortunes, are slack in the purse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not so bad but it might have been worse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great things, the year past, were reveal'd to our eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dutch have confess'd us their friends and allies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbled the pride of our haughty invaders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fighting their fleets and destroying their traders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the English succeeded in taking the Count,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what, in the end, did their conquest amount?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their boasts, and their brags, and their shouts of applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It but sav'd them from ruin&mdash;not ruin'd our cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But leaving the weight of political cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those, who are plac'd at the helm of affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the humours of fortune in all things resign'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean by my visit to put you in mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, as true as a clock, both early and late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the news of the day I have knock'd at your gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave you to know what the world was a doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Louis intended, or George was a brewing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If sometimes the papers were trifling and flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the news went against us,&mdash;I cou'dn't help that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If parties were angry, and vented their spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bro't you their wranglings&mdash;not help'd them to write.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore presume (and not without reason)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll remember your Newsman, and think of the season;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The markets are high, and the weather is cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No party I serve, and no pension I hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We Hawkers are men, and have children and wives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort our hearts, and to solace our lives:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if I say more, you'll think it is stuff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a word to the wise is, in reason, enough.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While Timon, with malicious spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allows you not a grain of merit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he an idle pomp assumes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him return his borrow'd plumes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And contradicted common reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By making this the mirthful season,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all is dreary, dull, and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun to southern climates fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dart his fierce and downright beams<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And not a leaf upon the trees!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis wrong&mdash;the very birds will say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who made it his study to banish our fears:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Poured on us a tempest of round shot and langrage;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The women miscarried, the beaux were all frighten'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my part, I hid in a cellar (as sages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christians were wont in the primitive ages:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus the Prophet of old that was wrapt to the sky,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He rose and came out with his mystical cloak)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I hardly could boast of a moment of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dogs were a-howling, the town was distrest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But our terrors soon vanished, for suddenly Sears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewed our lost courage and dried up our tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our memories, indeed, must have strangely decayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we cannot remember what speeches he made,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">From this very day 'till the British came in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lived, I may say, in the Desert of Sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such beating, and bruising, and scratching, and tearing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such kicking, and cuffing, and cursing and swearing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they advanced with their numerous fleet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mistrusted their meaning, and foolishly fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the rest of the dunces I mounted my steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And galloped away with incredible speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Newark I hastened,&mdash;but trouble and care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got up on the crupper and followed me there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There I scarcely got fuel to keep myself warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarcely found spirits to weather the storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was quickly convinced I had little to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The Whigs were in arms, and my readers were few)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So after remaining one cold winter season,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stuffing my papers with something like treason,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meeting misfortunes and endless disasters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced to submit to a hundred new masters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought it more prudent to hold to the one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (after repenting of what I had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cursing my folly and idle pursuits)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned to the city, and hung up my boots.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Like a sheep on the mountains, or rather a swine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Worked out my salvation, at least for a while;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parson pronounced me deserving of grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they restored me to printing and place.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But days, such as these, were too happy to last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sand of felicity settled too fast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I swore and protested I honoured the throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The least they could do was to let me alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though George I compared to an angel above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wanted some solider proofs of my love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they obliged me each morning to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn in the ranks at the beat of the drum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While often, too often (I tell it with pain)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They menaced my head with a hickory cane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While others, my betters, as much were opprest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shame and confusion shall cover the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You, doubtless, will think I am dealing in fable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I tell you I guard an officer's stable&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With usage like this my feelings are stung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next thing will be, I must heave out the dung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six hours in the day is duty too hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rivington sneers whene'er I mount guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughs till his sides are ready to split<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his jests, and his satires, and sayings of wit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he's excused, on account of his post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cannot go by without making his boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if I was all that is servile and mean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fortune, perhaps, may alter the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give him his turn to stand in the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt brandy supporting his animal heat&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_226_283" id="FNanchor_226_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_283" class="fnanchor">[226]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what for the king or the cause has he done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we must be toiling while he can look on?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great conquests he gave them on paper&mdash;'tis true<a name="FNanchor_227_284" id="FNanchor_227_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_284" class="fnanchor">[227]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Howe was retreating, he made him pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alack! it's too plain that Britons must fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When loaded with laurels&mdash;they go to the wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From hence you may guess I do nothing but grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where we are going I cannot conceive&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wisest among us a change are expecting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not for nothing, these ships are collecting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not for nothing, that Matthews, the mayor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And legions of Tories, for sailing prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not for nothing, that John Coghill Knap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is filing his papers, and plugging his tap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Skinner himself, the fighting attorney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is boiling potatoes, to serve a long journey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where they are going, or meaning to travel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would puzzle John Faustus himself to unravel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps to Penobscot, to starve in the barrens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps to St. John's, in the gulph of St. Lawrence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps to New-Scotland, to perish with cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps to Jamaica, like slaves to be sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, scorched by the summer, all nature repines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Ph&#339;bus, great Ph&#339;bus, too glaringly shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce from the zenith diverging his ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppresses the isle with a torrent of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Since matters are thus, with proper submission<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permit me to offer my humble Petition:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though the form is uncommon, and lawyers may sneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With truth I can tell you, the scribe is sincere.)<br /></span>

appearing Jan. 8, 1783. Hugh Gaine began as a printer in New York in 1750,
and two years later established the <i>New York Mercury</i>. His imprint for
many years was "Printed by Hugh Gaine, Printer, Bookseller, Stationer,
at the Bible and Crown, in Hanover Square." Upon the beginning of
hostilities with England he at first sided with the patriots. "Gaine's political
creed it seems was to join the strongest party. When the British troops
were about to take possession of New York in 1776, he left the city and set up
his press at Newark; but soon after, in the belief that appearances were
against the ultimate success of the United States, be privately withdrew from
Newark and returned to New York. At the conclusion of the war, he petitioned
the State legislature for leave to remain in the city and, having obtained
permission, his press was employed in book printing, etc., but his newspaper
was discontinued when the British army left."&mdash;Thomas' <i>History of Philadelphia</i>.

"While on one of his visits at Gaine's a customer saluted him loudly by
name, the sound of which arrested the attention of the old Royalist, who, lifting
up his eyes, interrogated him: 'Is your name Freneau?' 'Yes,' answered
the Republican poet. '<i>Philip</i> Freneau?' rejoined Gaine. 'Yes sir! the
same.' 'Then, sir,' warmly uttered Gaine, 'you are a very clever fellow.
Let me have the pleasure of taking you by the hand. Will you walk round the
corner and join me in my parlor. We will take a glass of wine together. You,
sir, have given me and my paper a wide reputation."</p></div>

<span class="i1">Dark glooms the day that sees me leave this shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which fate whispers I must come no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From civil broils what dire disasters flow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those broils condemn me to a land of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where barren pine trees shade the dreary steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frown o'er the soil or murmur to the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sullen fogs their heavy wings expand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nine months' winter chills the dismal land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could no kind stars have mark'd a different way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars that presided on my natal day?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why is not man endued with power to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ends and upshots of events below?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did not heaven (some other gift deny'd)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach me to take the true-born Buckskin side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show me the balance of the wavering fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fortune smiling on these new-born States!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Friend of my heart!&mdash;my refuge and relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who help'd me on through seven long years of grief,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span><span class="i0">Whose better genius taught you to remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the soft quiet of your rural reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who still despised the Rebels and their cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while you paid the taxes, damn'd their laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wisely stood spectator of the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor trusted George, whate'er he chose to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice happy thou, who wore a double face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the balance turn'd could each embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too happy Janus! had I shar'd thy art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak a language foreign to my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stoop'd from pomp and dreams of regal state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To court the friendship of the men I hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These strains of woe had not been penn'd to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor I to foreign climes been forc'd away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! George&mdash;that name provokes my keenest rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did he not swear, and promise, and engage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His loyal sons to nurture and defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be their God, their father and their friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet basely quits us on a hostile coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves us wretched where we need him most:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His is the part to promise and deceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him we wander and by him we grieve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the first day that these dissentions grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Gage to Boston brought his blackguard crew,<a name="FNanchor_239_297" id="FNanchor_239_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_297" class="fnanchor">[239]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">From town to town have run our various race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And acted all that's mean and all that's base&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;from that day until this hour we roam,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When hostile tribes their plighted faith shall own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swear subjection to the British throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When George the Fourth shall their petitions spurn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banish'd Tories to their fields return.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From dreams of conquest, worlds and empires won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Britain awaking, mourns her setting sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No rays of joy her evening hour illume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis one sad chaos, one unmingled gloom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon she sinks unheeded to the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No eye to pity and no hand to save:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are her crimes that she alone must bend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where are her hosts to conquer and defend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must she alone with these new regions part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These realms that lay the nearest to her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soar'd at once to independent power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not sunk like Scotland in the trying hour?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See slothful Spaniards golden empires keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rule vast realms beyond the Atlantic deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must we alone surrender half our reign,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But we, sad outcasts from our native reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven from these shores, a poor deluded train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In distant wilds, conducted by despair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even now yon' tribes, the foremost of the band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Croud to the ships and cover all the strand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forc'd from their friends, their country, and their God,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And virgin grief, and poverty, and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, all with aching hearts prepare to sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late repentance that has no avail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet I stand on this forbidden ground<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And threat'ning hosts with vengeance on their brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry, "Where are Britain's base adherents now?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, hot for vengeance, by resentment led,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In one firm league I see them all combin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, like the damn'd, can no forgiveness find&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon might Satan from perdition rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lost angels gain their vanish'd skies<br /></span>

"Monday at noon, the sheriff, attended by the proper officers, made proclamation
of the Definitive Treaty of Peace concluded between America and
Great-Britain. At the same time the state flag was hoisted on Market street
wharf, and in the evening the transparent paintings which were designed in
celebration of the general peace, and were to have been shewn on the 22d
January last, but prevented by an unfortunate accident; being revived by
subscription, and executed by the ingenious Mr. Peale, were exhibited, and afforded
great satisfaction to many thousands of spectators.

The following is a Description of the Triumphal Arch and its ornaments:
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">The</span> Arch is fifty Feet and six Inches wide, and thirty-five Feet and
six Inches high, exclusive of the Ballustrade, which is three Feet and nine
Inches in height. The Arch is fourteen Feet wide in the clear, and each of the
smaller Arches nine feet. The Pillars are of the <i>Ionic</i> Order. The Entablature,
all the other Parts, and the Proportions correspond with that Order;
and the whole Edifice is finished in the Style of Architecture proper for such
a Building, and used by the <i>Romans</i>. The Pillars are adorned with spiral
Festoons of Flowers in their natural Colours.... [Then follows a half-column

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_278_341" id="Footnote_278_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_278_341"><span class="label">[278]</span></a> From the edition of 1809. The poem seems first to have appeared in the
<i>National Gazette</i> of January 12, 1792, with the following note: "The following
lines were written some years ago (Sept. 1784) on board the brig <i>Dromilly</i>,
in Kingston harbour, Jamaica; and sent to the keeper of the King's waterworks,
near Rock fort; who had refused the writer a puncheon of water from a
reservoir that was, by royal order, appropriated to the use of the royal navy."
The present text is somewhat varied from that in the edition of 1795.</p></div>

For the 1809 edition Freneau made numerous verbal changes. On an average,
he changed a word in every line. No poem of Freneau's shows more clearly
his peculiar mania for revision. In the 1795 edition the title is "Port Royal,"
in the 1809 edition it is "Written at Port Royal, in the Island of Jamaica&mdash;September,

"It is believed that Robert Bell, an Englishman or a Scotchman, who
came to Philadelphia about 1772 or 1773, was the first person who kept a circulating
library in this city. He had his place of business in Third street below
Walnut. He was also one of the first to establish book auctions here, in which
effort he met very serious opposition from the booksellers. He published
several works prior to the Revolutionary War, but during that struggle he
seems to have left the city. He died in Richmond, Va., Sept. 26, 1784."&mdash;<i>Watson's

Cavallo made his memorable experiments, may be taken as the initial date in

first balloon ascension, though he ventured only fifty feet from the ground.
On November 21st of the same year, with the Marquis d'Arlandes, he made
the first aerial expedition, ascending from the castle la Muette in the presence

introduction:
</p><p>
"On Saturday morning last [March 5] departed this life in the forty-third
year of his age, <span class="smcap">General Joseph Reed</span>, Esq., formerly President of this
State; and on Sunday his remains were interred in the Presbyterian burying
ground in Arch Street. His funeral was attended by his excellency the President
and the Superior Executive Council, the Honourable the Speaker and the
General Assembly, the Militia Officers and a greater number of citizens than
we've ever seen here on any similar occasion." Text follows the edition of 1809.
</p><p>
Reed was one of the leading figures of the Revolutionary era. As delegate
to the Continental Congress, aide and secretary to Washington, Adjutant
General, volunteer soldier, and Governor of Pennsylvania, he was an active and
able man, and his early death was much regretted.</p></div>

It appeared first in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, August 2, 1786, and was republished
in the edition of 1788, and in the later editions, almost without change. The
poet probably refers to the <i>Rhododendron Viscosum</i>, or as some call it the
<i>Asalia viscosun</i> since it is the only flower popularly known as the wild honeysuckle
that is both white and fragrant. According to Chapman's <i>Southern
Flora</i>, it flowers in the latitude of Charleston in July and August. The text

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_325_412" id="Footnote_325_412"></a><a href="#FNanchor_325_412"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> The first trace I can find of this poem is in the initial number of Matthew
Carey's <i>American Museum</i>, Jan. 1, 1787, where it is placed among the selected
poetry and assigned to P. Freneau. This testimony of Carey's as to its genuineness
carries with it considerable weight. Knapp, who in 1829 reviewed the
poem as Freneau's, doubtless had before him a copy of the <i>Museum</i>. The
poem, however, is not included in any of the poet's collections and I can find
no earlier newspaper appearance, although my search has not been exhaustive.
The authenticity of a poem suspected to be Freneau's may always be gravely
doubted if it is not found to be included in his collected works, for he hoarded
his poetic product, especially in his earlier period, with miserly care.
</p><p>
The poem appeared in 1806 among the poems of Mrs. John Hunter with
the title "The Death Song, written for and adapted to, an original Indian
air." Several of Mrs. Hunter's best poems had been long in circulation before
she was induced to collect them. In 1822 Maria Edgeworth introduced the
poem into her book "Rosamond," ascribing it to her. She added the following
note: "The idea of this ballad was suggested several years ago by hearing a
gentleman who resided many years among the tribe called the Cherokees, sing
a wild air, which he assured me was customary for these people to chant with
a barbarous jargon implying contempt for their enemies in the moments of
torture and death. I have endeavored to give something of the characteristic
spirit and sentiment of those brave savages."</p></div>

there he seems to have been greatly impressed by an instance of inconstancy.
He has in several prose sketches, notably in "Light Summer Reading," 1788,
and in the following series of poems, composed at different times, described the
incident. There is a tradition that Freneau spent several weeks in the family
of the Governor of Bermuda and that it was the daughter of this official who
was the unfortunate Amanda. Some traditions have mentioned Freneau himself
as the lover. The text is from the edition of 1809.</p></div>

of composition Jan. 26, 1787. The lady's name in this original version was
Cynthia. The poem was reprinted in the 1788 collection as a part of the story
"Light Summer Reading." The half mad poet, who is infatuated with the
lovely Marcia, writes the verses and inscribes them "To Marcia." It seems to
have been a favorite with the poet. He republished it in the <i>National Gazette</i>
in 1792 under the title "Marcella in a Consumption." Text from the edition

<span class="i0">The man will be ruin'd!&mdash;he must, if he will&mdash;!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They may live to repent it&mdash;before the year's out!"<br /></span>

<h4>II. <i>Characters of the</i> <span class="smcap">Travellers</span></h4>

<p class="cblockquot"><span class="smcap">William Snip</span>, <i>Merchant Taylor</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">As I never could relish to travel alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look'd round about, but could hit upon none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Satan was tempting to leave their own houses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ramble to York with their daughters and spouses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, by repeating my trouble and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And preaching a month on the sweets of fresh air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the curse and the plague of remaining in town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the heat was sufficient to melt a man down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I got a few friends to consent to the trip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first I shall mention was honest Will. Snip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philadelphia the famous had own'd to his birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gravest of towns on the face of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where saints of all orders their freedom may claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poets, and painters, and girls of the game:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him all its streets and its alleys were known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his travels had never exceeded the town:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A salesman by trade (and a dabster was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a silk knee-band set snug to the knee)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his wife (and he says I may mention her name)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Susanna Snipinda&mdash;so charming a dame,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun had with pleasure look'd down on her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So freckled was she, and her tresses so red.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To wait on the will of so handsome a lady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youngster was order'd to hold himself ready,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sly looking lad that was 'prentice to Snip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long had been learning to cabbage and clip;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Snip was in sight, he was mild as a lamb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When absent, old Satan could hardly rule Sam.<br /></span>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">O'Keef</span>, <i>a Swaggering Captain</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The next I describe is bold captain O'Keef,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A killer of men, and a lover of beef:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the heroes of old he had put in his claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And catch'd at their mantles, and rose into fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sound of a fife and the tune of no song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his Andra Ferrara<a name="FNanchor_CO_453" id="FNanchor_CO_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_453" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> he paddled along:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his manners so rough, and his dealing in ruin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was known thro' the town by the name of Sir Bruin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was, among women, a man of great parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A captain of foot, and a master of arts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had, a sweet creature put under his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whose style of address was, my dear, and my dear)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Milliner's girl, with a bundle of lace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Cynthia<a name="FNanchor_CP_454" id="FNanchor_CP_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_454" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> he call'd, for the sake of her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At a ball or a frolic how glib his tongue ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was, I may say, an unparallell'd man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Very apt to harangue on the hosts he has slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of people&mdash;perhaps that may meet him again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet so kind to the sex of the feminine make,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his words, he would venture to die for their sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence some have suspected, that some he ador'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have more than made up for the wastes of his sword.<br /></span>

<h4>IV. <span class="smcap">Touppee</span>: <i>a French Hair Dresser</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The third in succession was Monsieur Touppee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A barber from Paris, of royal degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For oft when he takes up his razor, to strap it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tells his descent from the house of Hugh Capet<a name="FNanchor_CQ_455" id="FNanchor_CQ_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_CQ_455" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' soft in the head, his discourses were long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now counting his honours, and now his l'argent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This barber, tho' meaning for pleasure to stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet had some pomatum to sell by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfumes, and fine powders, and essence of myrrh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bundle of brooms, and a firkin of beer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His merits are great (he would have us suppose)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Louis (it seems) he has had by the nose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has bid him, when drooping, to hold up his chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And handled a tongs&mdash;at the head of the Queen.<br /></span>

<h4>V. <span class="smcap">Bob</span>: <i>a Ballad Singer</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">A singer of ballads was next in our train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who long had been dealing in ballads in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sometimes would sing in a musical tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes would scribble a song of his own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never was seen with his brethren to mix&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laugh'd at your poets in coaches and six;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sing, like the birds, when the weather is fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose verses the ladies pronounce "so divine;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ride with Augustus, wherever he goes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, meeting old Homer, would turn up the nose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to those, like himself, that were held to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew it was folly to feed them with sound&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew it was nonsense to crown them with bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was too much their friend to insult them with praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a dozen long years he had liv'd by the mob:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the word of a weaver, I pitied poor Bob!<a name="FNanchor_361_456" id="FNanchor_361_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_456" class="fnanchor">[361]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had sung for the great and had rhym'd for the small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely a shilling had got by them all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bad was his luck, and so poor was the trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Muses, he thought, were so sneakingly paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if times didn't alter, and that very soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said and he swore, he must sing his last tune.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some devil had put it, somehow, in his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he took a short journey his fortune was made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some devil had told him (but whether in dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or waking, I know not) some devil, it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had made him believe that the nymphs and the swains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were fairly at war with their old fashion'd strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the tunes which the kirk or the curates had made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And which always had ruin'd the balladman's trade)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wholly disus'd, and that now was the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For singers of catches and dealers in rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To step from their stalls, where they long were disgrac'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reform the old music, and fix a new taste.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>VI. <span class="smcap">O'Bluster</span>: <i>a Seaman</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">A mate of a schooner, bespatter'd with tar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had lately come in from Savanna-la-Mar,<a name="FNanchor_CR_457" id="FNanchor_CR_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_CR_457" class="fnanchor">[F]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span><span class="i0">For, the sake of an airing had stept from his deck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ventur'd a jaunt, at the risque of his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name and his nation no soul could mistake.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was Bryan O'Bluster, and much of a rake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From morning till night he was still on the move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was always in taverns, or always in love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life was sustain'd by the virtues of grog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many long miles he had sail'd by the log.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battles and storms he had known a full share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his face, it was plain, was the worse for the wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see a mean fellow, lord how it would fret him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hated a puppy, wherever he met him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was ready to bleed for the good of each State,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since they had left the poor seamen to fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves in the dumps, and their fair ones in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many brave fellows detain'd in Algiers!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had spirit sufficient to make themselves free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to resent their affronts on the sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As this was the case&mdash;he must bid us good night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sail with a flag that would do itself right.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At cursing and swearing he play'd a good hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never was easy a minute on land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the wind was a-head, or his Kitty untrue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, patience was all the relief that he knew:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of misfortune he still was serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Kitty, he said, was a feeble machine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart was too hard for a lady to sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I guess'd him a rogue by the leer in his eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"The world (he would say) is a whimsical dance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reason had taught him to leave it to chance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chace of dame Fortune his prime he had pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now was beginning to fail very fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thought it was folly his heart to perplex,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Fortune was just like the rest of her sex;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span><span class="i0">Designing, and fickle, and taken with show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now fond of a monkey, and now of a beau:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, still, as the goddess was made up of whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He meant to pursue 'till she smil'd upon him."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho' he was always deceiv'd in the chace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smooth'd up his whiskers, and wore a bold face.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On horseback he first had attempted to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the horse was no fool, and had give him a throw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell in a pond, and with not a dry rag on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse brought him back to the sign of the waggon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where three times he call'd for a dram of their best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three times the virtues of brandy confess'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then took some tobacco, and soberly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"De'il take such a vessel; she's all by the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broach'd to on a sudden, and then, d'ye see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself and the saddle went over the lee."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His head was so full of his ragged command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could scarcely believe he was yet on dry land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would rise in his sleep; call the watch up at four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask the man at the helm how the Eddystone bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, rubbing his eyes, bawl out, "By my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We are bearing right down on the Hatteras shoal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The devil may trust to such pilots as you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We are close on the breakers&mdash;the breakers&mdash;halloo!"<br /></span>

<h4>VII. <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>: <i>a Rhode-Island Lawyer</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The sixth, and the last, that attended our journey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a man of the law, a Rhode-Island attorney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cunning as Satan to argue or plead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break an entailment, or get himself fee'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call'd him Ezekiel&mdash;I cannot tell what&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span><span class="i0">He had once been a parson, and studied at Yale,<a name="FNanchor_CS_458" id="FNanchor_CS_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_CS_458" class="fnanchor">[G]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But took to the law, when his preaching grew stale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his system of thinking, not well understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wander'd about, like a man in a wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From morning 'till night he was nothing but whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a man in the town held opinions, like him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In regard to the vulgar, he argued that Law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was better than preaching, to keep them in awe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the dread of a gallows had greater effect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a post or a pillory claim'd more respect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a knave&mdash;and would sooner contribute to mend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the grave precepts that ever were penn'd.<br /></span>

<h4>VIII.  <i>The Chapter of</i> <span class="smcap">Debates</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Having pitch'd on our party, there rose a dispute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the mode of conveyance&mdash;in waggon or boat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my part, said Snip, I was always afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sailors, and sloops and the shallopman's trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the reason thereof I will candidly tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My grandmother, Mopsy, was drown'd in a well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore intreat you, and fervently pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may go with the waggons the Burlington way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hold, master," the sailor replied in a fret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The devil's not ready to bait for you yet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even this way, you know, there is water to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twenty long miles we should sail with an ass;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, gentlemen all, will you take my advice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's Albertson's<a name="FNanchor_CT_459" id="FNanchor_CT_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_CT_459" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> sloop; she's so new and so nice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bottom so sleek, and her rigging so trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Bailey<a href="#Footnote_CT_459" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> or Hyde<a href="#Footnote_CT_459" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> can be mentioned with him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her cabbin and steerage is plenty of room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how clever she looks with her flying jib-boom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A topsail aloft, that will stand by the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a yard rigg'd athwart, for a squaresail design'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Odds fish! I would sooner some little delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than go, like a booby, the fresh-water way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where your cream-colour'd captains ne'er swear a bad word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sail without compass or quadrant on board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch catfish and sturgeons, but never a whale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor balance a mizen, to fight with the gale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Albertson goes by the route of Cape May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salt-water, and sees the bold porpusses play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the shore of the coast the proud ocean controuls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He travels, nor strikes on the Barnegat shoals."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"You tar-smelling monster! (Snipinda rejoin'd)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your jargon has almost distracted my mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Snip should be drownded, and lost in the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You never once think what a loss it would be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should then be a widow, dejected and sad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where would I find such another sweet lad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Doctor Sangrado a letter has wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how, in three weeks he will want a new coat."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Snip's heart, at her answer, seem'd ready to break:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Snipinda," said he, "I would live for your sake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I should be drownded, indeed, it is true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would be a bad journey for Sam and for you!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For fear they should hear him, Sam whisper'd, "In troth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would give my new hat that the devil had both."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"If Snip should be drown'd," said the valiant O'Keef,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Poor woman! already I guess at her grief&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, for aught that a stranger can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are dozens as brisk at the needle as he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, tho' it were hard that the sea-fish should tear him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm fully convinc'd that his brethren can spare him:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"But were I to mention the very best way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the quickest to boot (for they go in a day)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would sleep over night at the sign of the Queen,<a name="FNanchor_CU_460" id="FNanchor_CU_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_CU_460" class="fnanchor">[I]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Where the wine is so good, and the beds are so clean)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then starting by day-break, and riding in state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving in Bristol&mdash;we breakfast at eight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then push on our way, with a rapid career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nothing to hinder, and nothing to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Trenton, and Princeton, and Brunswick are pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And safe on the Hudson they drop us at last."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the captain had finish'd, the Frenchman arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smoothing his whiskers, and squaring his toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a bend of his back, and a swing of his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus expressing his wish, with a flourish, he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wherever pomatums are most in demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That route has my vote, be it water or land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever I travel, through sun-shine or glooms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May fortune direct me to powders and plumes!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, gentlemen, choose, I beseech you, that road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ladies prefer to be dress'd in the mode."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Hold, varlet, be still"&mdash;said the Yankee attorney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Are you to decide on the route of our journey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These run-about fellows, I cannot but hate 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their rings, and their ruffles, and rolls of pomatum:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, gentlemen, (if I may venture to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the stile I was wont when I dabbled in Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I blew on my trumpet, and call'd up my pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought I was holy because I was black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if you allow me a moral to draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some words that were frequent with Doctor Magraw);&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span><span class="i0">"We all have in view to arrive at one town,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"To march all together to Zion"&mdash;said he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, since I'm convinc'd that it cannot be so,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like the sects in religion, I heartily pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each, as he pleases, may have his own way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Snip, and the captain, adventure by land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sailor by sea&mdash;he can reef, steer, and hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the Frenchman set out in a gaudy balloon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(He'll either be there, or be dead, very soon,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my own part, I'm fond of the Burlington boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still, if you're willing, I'll put it to vote:<br /></span>

<h4>IX. <i>The Passage to</i> <span class="smcap">Burlington</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The morning was fair, and the wind was at west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flood coming in, and the ladies were drest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sign of the Billet we all were to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Snip was the first that appear'd in the street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strutted along with a mighty brisk air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Sam and Snipinda walked slow in the rear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dress'd, booted, and button'd, and "cutting a shine"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain came next, with his loaded carbine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then handed on board the milliner's maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barber and ballad-man longer delay'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one had his ballads to sing and to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the other some beards to take off by the way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last they arriv'd, and the sailor along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(But he was besotted&mdash;his dram had been strong&mdash;)<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span><span class="i0">The lawyer, Ezekiel, was last to appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a cane in his hand and a quill at his ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, just as we all were prepar'd to embark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind came a-head, and the weather look'd dark:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, whilst they were busy in hoisting the sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trimming close aft' to encounter the gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our seaman advis'd them to take in a reef<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the vessel was light&mdash;but the skipper was deaf:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"His boat was his own"&mdash;and he knew to a hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "worth of her freight," and the "sail she could bear."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then a storm coming on, we stow'd away snug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some link'd with a lady, and some with a jug:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snipinda and Sam were inclining to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lawyer harangu'd on the risques of the deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'Bluster was busy in looking for squalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cynthia discours'd upon dances and balls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the poor ballad-man gave us a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Frenchman complain'd that his stomach felt wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Arriving, at length at the end of this stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We quitted our cabbin (or rather our cage)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sign of the Anchor we then were directed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where captain O'Keef a fine turkey dissected;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bryan O'Bluster made love to egg-nog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pester'd the ladies to taste of his grog:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without it (said Bryan) I never can dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis better, by far, than your balderdash wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It braces the nerves and it strengthens the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world&mdash;and no grog&mdash;is a prison of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Man, the most wretched of all that are found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To creep in the dust, or to move on the ground!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is, of all physic, the best I have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep out the cold, and to cut up the spleen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span><span class="i0">Here, madam&mdash;miss Cynthia&mdash;'tis good&mdash;you'll confess&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now taste&mdash;and you'll wish you had been in my mess&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grog I'm as great as a king on his throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worst of all countries is&mdash;where there is none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New Holland, New Zealand&mdash;those islands accurs'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's health to the man that invented it first.<br /></span>

<h4>X. <span class="smcap">Vexations</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Disasters</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Coop'd up in a waggon, the curtains let down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At three in the morning we drove out of town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A morning more dark I ne'er saw in my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fog you might almost have cut with a knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a fit season for murders and rapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For drunken adventures and narrow escapes:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, with something to think of, but little to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The driver drove on, looking out for the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till we came to the brow of a horrible hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six miles on our road, when the cattle stood still&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Are you sure you have took the right road?"&mdash;queried Snip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am"&mdash;said the driver&mdash;and crack'd with his whip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then away ran the horses, but took the wrong road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away went the waggon, with all its full load;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down, deep in a valley, roll'd over and over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell the flying-machine, with its curtains and cover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shatter'd and shiver'd&mdash;no glimpse yet of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mass of destruction, together we lay!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then howlings were heard, that would frighten a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And screeching, and screaming, and many a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bruising of heads, and the breaking of shins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contrition of heart, and confession of sins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">First rose from his ruins tall captain O'Keef,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call'd to Ezekiel, and begg'd for his brief:<a name="FNanchor_CV_461" id="FNanchor_CV_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_CV_461" class="fnanchor">[J]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A writ he demanded, as soon as 'twas day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask'd his advice, if a suit would not lay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then felt for his sword, but chanc'd on a cane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush'd at the stageman, to cleave him in twain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As fortune would have it, the stageman had fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Snip the whole vengeance receiv'd on his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The staff had been whirl'd with so deadly a sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Will in a moment was all in a heap:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was room to surmise that his senses were hurt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, in spite of our bruises, he made us some sport:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head, he conceited, was made of new cheese;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask'd, if the sexton would give up his fees?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, rolling away on the side of the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his head in a horse-pond, he lay very still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last he bawl'd out&mdash;"I'm sick at my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come hither, companions, and see me depart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snipinda, Snipinda!&mdash;alas, I must leave her&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all, for the sake of this villainous weaver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never would give me a moment of rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till I left my dear shop-board, and thus am distrest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a time will arrive (if I deem not amiss)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Slender, the weaver, will suffer for this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May his breeches, be always too big for his wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so narrow and scant as to torture his rear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May his waistcoat be ever too long or too short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the skirts of his tunic not both of a sort;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when from this sorrowful jaunt you return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell Doctor Sangrado 'tis needless to mourn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! tell him I firmly believ'd I was going<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where people no longer are wed-ding and wooing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where white linen stockings will ever be clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sky-men are clad in the best of nankeen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where with old Continental our debts we can pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a suit of best broad-cloth will last but a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where with pretty brass thimbles the streets are all pav'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a remnant&mdash;if not a whole piece&mdash;shall be sav'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where cloth may be cabbag'd&mdash;and that without fear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And journeymen work&mdash;thirteen months to the year!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Snipinda was mov'd at so dismal a yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And groping about to find where he fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclaim'd, "I have got a sad bruise on one hip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But matters, I fear, are much worse with poor Snip."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Yes, yes"&mdash;answer'd Snip&mdash;"I'm preparing to go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be speedy, Snipinda, my pulse is so low!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then she went where he lay, and took hold of his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisper'd the captain, "how much he has bled!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For she thought, as he lay with his nose in the puddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the water was blood, that had flow'd from his noddle.)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Ah! where is the doctor, to give him a pill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where is the Lawyer, to write his last-will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ezekiel! Ezekiel! attend to his words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am his widow, I must have my thirds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But can you"&mdash;and here she reclin'd on his breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And can you resolve to forsake me distrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it thus you would quit me, my joy and my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me alone for the shop-boards above:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it thus you consign me to trouble and woe?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you are departed, ah! where shall I go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall then be a widow&mdash;forsaken and sad&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where shall I find such another sweet lad?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then will afford me a mint-water dram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gallant me to meeting&mdash;and who will flog Sam?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">By this time the story was currently spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And most were convinc'd that the taylor was dead,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The taylor is dead beyond all relief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taylor is dead," cry'd captain O'Keef:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To fetch up a fashion, or trump up a whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a knight of the thimble was equal to him!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"The taylor is dead"&mdash;(the lawyer exclaim'd)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God speed him!&mdash;'tis better to die than be maim'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If life is a race, as the learned pretend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help him! his racing is soon at an end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His anchor is cast, and his canvas is furl'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A creature he was, so attach'd to the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So eager for money&mdash;(I say it with grief)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never consider'd the 'fall of the leaf.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is come (we may say) to the end of his tether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the maid and her master shall lay down together.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the place where he's gone may we also prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the Mind, when admitted, shall rest from her care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiddles&mdash;the finest that ever were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall play, for his comfort, a brisk Bonny Jean.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"The taylor is dead" (said the company round)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The taylor is dead"&mdash;the dark forests resound.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He is dead!"&mdash;blubber'd Sam, with a counterfeit sigh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sailor bawl'd out&mdash;"By my soul it's a lie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fellow has only a mind for some fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blood is not cold, and his race is not run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head, it is true, may have had a small shock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll bind it&mdash;'twill only be strapping a block:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, hand me a neck-cloth, a napkin, a clout!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now&mdash;heave up his noddle, and strap it about!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success to the skull that can bear a good jirk&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They only have damag'd his ginger-bread work."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The matters turn'd out as he said and he swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the taylor threw open his peepers once more.<br /></span>

<h4>XI. <span class="smcap">Conclusion</span> <i>of the Journey</i></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">When the morning appear'd, it is horrid to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mischiefs the most of our crew had befel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bundle lay here, and a budget lay there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Frenchman was fretting and pulling his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horses were feeding about on the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Snip, with his head on a hassock lay still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The driver beseech'd us the fault to excuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night had been dark&mdash;and "he lost both his shoes"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then he rais'd up his waggon, rejoicing to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, by leaving the top and the curtains behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We still might proceed&mdash;for the body was sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wheels, upon searching, uninjur'd all 'round.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But dull and dishearten'd we travell'd along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our waggon dismantled, our harness all wrong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawyer was vext that we went a snail's pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cynthia was sure she had lost half her lace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Bryan O'Bluster, who Snip had restor'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asserted, that Snip was the Jonas on board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often declar'd, in his moments of glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He would give him a souse, if he had him at sea."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At length, we arriv'd, with the marks of our fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halted to dine at the town of Road-Hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honest David has always a dish of the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snipinda declar'd there was nothing well drest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And Snip (she exclaim'd) I would ask him to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I know that he never could relish roast-meat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think it were better to get him some Tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He always was fond of slop dinners, like me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then he could never endure your Bohea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La! madam, is this the best tea that you keep?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the taste and the smell, you have purchas'd it cheap!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Hyson or Congo to give a sick stranger!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor man! I've no doubt but his life is in danger!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"No doctor like Neptune for people like him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Quoth O'Bluster)&mdash;his illness is merely a whim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I had him at sea, with the rest of our crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should dance to the tune of a bowl of Burgoo!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"From all that appears (said captain O'Keef)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I judge he might venture to taste the roast beef,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay&mdash;I think I can guess, from the cast of his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He longs to have hold of the gooseberry pye!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why captain (she cry'd) would you kill the poor sinner?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he cannot have tea, he shall go without dinner!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">At length to the Ferry we safely arrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each thanking his genius he still was alive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Cynthia complain'd of abundance of harms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black on her face and the blue on her arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snipinda exclaim'd that she wanted a patch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Snip, in his ravings, had give her a scratch:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corpse of the captain was merely a wreck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sailor complain'd of a kink in his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a contusion, beside, on his thigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ballad-man talk'd of a bruise on his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just adding, "how much he was vext at the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no one regarded the song-singing art:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the town was in love with his music (he said)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never consider'd he liv'd by the trade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That affronts and neglect were forever his lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lovers of music respected him&mdash;not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had sung for the nymphs, and had sung for the swains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they were unwilling to purchase his strains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he put up his ballads and call'd for his pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds slunk off, and the nymphs ran away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">So, we said what we could to encourage poor Bob,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitied his fortune,&mdash;to live by the mob:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advis'd him to cobble, cut throats, or dig ditches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he wish'd to advance to perferment and riches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the time had arriv'd, when a sycophant race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of poets are only promoted to place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should scorn them alike, if attach'd to a crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing lies to a court, or disguis'd in the gown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a poet of genius (all history shews)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er wanted a puppy, to bark at his muse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though their productions were never once read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Bavius and Mevius must also be fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then the skipper came in, with a terrible noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclaiming, "The wherry is ready, my boys:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sails are unfurl'd, and the clock has struck eight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away to the wharf, for no longer I wait!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now all were embark'd, and the boat under sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a dark cloudy sky and a stiff blowing gale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In plying to windward we delug'd our decks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'Bluster discours'd of disasters and wrecks&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_360_451" id="Footnote_360_451"></a><a href="#FNanchor_360_451"><span class="label">[360]</span></a> First published in pamphlet form by Bailey, April, 1787, under the title,
"A Journey from Philadelphia to New-York by way of Burlington and South-Amboy.
By Robert Slender, Stocking Weaver." The advertisement in the
<i>Freeman's Journal</i> of April 25 declares that "Some truth in the occasion and
a good deal of fancy in the colouring mark the character of the above performance.
The style is smooth and easy and the pleasurable air that is diffused over
the whole piece will certainly render the whole poem acceptable to such as
choose to read it." The poem was republished in the editions of 1788 and
1795, the text of the latter of which I have used. It was again republished
in a twenty-four page pamphlet by Thomas Neversink, Philadelphia, Dec. 20,
1809, under the title "A Laughable Poem; or Robert Slender's Journey from
Philadelphia to New York." The earlier versions, of which the 1788 text was
a reprint, had the poem divided into four cantos. In the 1795 edition the subdivision
into sections was made. Freneau thoroughly revised the poem for
the 1795 edition, making very many changes, all for the better. He cut out
nearly all of the indelicate allusions and expressions of the earlier edition,
including the coarse but highly picturesque dialogue between the skipper and
the captain, and it has seemed best to me not to resurrect them. The 1809
edition was reprinted with little change from the 1795 version.</p></div>

in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, Sept. 3, 1788, with the preliminary remarks:
"The following copy of verses came accidentally into my hands. I am told
that it was written by Capt. Freneau and addressed to a young Quaker lady
who went passenger in his vessel to Georgia to reside in the western parts of
that State. From the New York Daily Advertiser." It was reprinted in the
1795 edition, and in the edition of 1809, where it has the note: "Miss Lydia
Morris, a young quaker lady, on her landing from the sloop Industry, at
Savannah, in Georgia, December 30th, 1806." I have followed the 1809 text.</p></div>

in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> of Dec. 9, 1789, with the title "The Pilot of Hatteras,
by Capt. Philip Freneau." Affixed was the note: "This celebrated
genius, the Peter Pindar of America, is now a master of a packet which runs
between New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. His tuneful numbers
during the war did much to soften the disagreeable sensations which a state of
warfare so generally occasions." The poem was reprinted in the <i>National
Gazette</i> of Jan. 16, 1792, with the note, "Written off the Cape, July, 1789, on
a voyage to South Carolina, being delayed sixteen days with strong gales
ahead." The poem was omitted from the edition of 1809.</p></div>

"The seat of government in South Carolina is removed by act of

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
