<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The present edition of the poetical works of Philip
Freneau was begun at the advice of the late lamented
Moses Coit Tyler. In his opinion there were few fields
in American history that needed exploring more, and
few that would require on the part of the explorer more
of the Columbus spirit.</p>

<p>It would be almost impossible for a poet to pass
more completely into the shadow than has Freneau
during the century since his activities closed. His
poems are, almost all of them in their earliest editions,
exceedingly rare and costly and only to be read by those
who can have access to the largest libraries, his letters
and papers have almost entirely disappeared, and his
biography in almost every book of reference has been
so distorted by misstatement and omission as to be really
grotesque.</p>

<p>This neglect has resulted not from lack of real
worth in the man, but from prejudices born during one
of the most bitter and stormy eras of partisan politics
that America has ever known. What Sidney Smith
said of Scotland at this period was true here: "The
principles of the French Revolution were fully afloat
and it is impossible to conceive a more violent and agitated
state of society." Freneau was a victim of this
intense era. New England rejected him with scorn and
all admirers of Washington echoed his epithet, "that
rascal Freneau." Thus it has become the tradition to
belittle his work, to vilify his character, and to sum up
his whole career, as a prominent New Englander has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>recently done, by alluding to him as a "creature of the
opposition."</p>

<p>Unprejudiced criticism, however, has always exalted
Freneau's work. The great Scotch dictator
Jeffrey, with all his scorn for American literature, could
say that "the time would arrive when his poetry, like
that of Hudibras, would command a commentator like
Gray;" and Sir Walter Scott once declared that "Eutaw
Springs [was] as fine a thing as there is of the kind in
the language." E. A. Duyckinck did not hesitate to
group him as one of "four of the most original writers
whom the country has produced," and S. G. W. Benjamin
could say in 1887: "In all the history of American
letters, or of the United States press, there is no figure
more interesting or remarkable, no career more versatile
and varied than that of Philip Freneau." Such testimony
might be multiplied. Surely had the poet been an
ordinary man, Jefferson would never have said "his
paper has saved our Constitution," Madison would not
have pronounced him a man of genius, and Adams
would hardly have admitted that he was a leading element
in his defeat.</p>

<p>I have endeavored not only to rescue the most significant
of Freneau's poems, but to arrange them as far
as possible in their order of composition, or at least in
the order in which they first appeared in print. It has
seemed to me highly important to do this since such an
arrangement, especially with a poet like Freneau, who
drew his themes almost wholly from the range of his
own observation, would be virtually an autobiography,
and since it would also furnish a running commentary
upon the history of a stirring period in our annals. The
task has been no slight one. It has necessitated a search
through the files of a large proportion of the early newspapers
and periodicals and a minute investigation of
every other source of possible information.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>
<p>Much material has been rescued that, as far as the
public was concerned, had practically become extinct.
I have introduced the unique fragment of an unpublished
drama, "The Spy," which I was the first to explore. I
have taken pains to reproduce the poet's early poetical
pamphlets dealing with the first year of the Revolution,
not one of which has ever been republished. The
revisions of many of these used by Freneau in his later
collections were so thoroughgoing as to be in reality
entirely new poems. "The Voyage to Boston," for
instance, published during the siege of Boston, was cut
down for the 1786 edition from six hundred and five
lines to three hundred and six lines, and of these more
than half were entirely changed. From the standpoint
of the historian, at least, the original version is much
more valuable than that made several years after the
war was over. This is true of all the earlier pamphlet
poems. Aside from their value as specimens of Freneau's
earlier muse they are valuable commentaries on
the history of the stormy times that called them forth,
and I have not hesitated to reprint them verbatim in
connection with the revised versions. The pamphlet
poems "American Liberty" and "General Gage's Confession,"
(until recently supposed to have been lost)
exist only in unique copies. Freneau never attempted
to revise them. Some of the other early poems, notably
"The House of Night," I have annotated with care,
showing the evolution of the poem from its first nucleus
to its final fragmentary form. In the case of a few of the
more important poems, especially those dealing with
the Revolution, I have given variorum readings.</p>

<p>Aside from this early material, which has a real historical
value, I have introduced very few poems not included
in Freneau's collected editions of 1786, 1788, 1795,
1809 and 1815. Previous to 1795 the poet reprinted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>with miserly care almost all the verses which he had
contributed to the press. In his later years he was
more prodigal of his creations. I have, however, reprinted
from newspapers very few poems not found
elsewhere, and these few only on the best evidence that
they were genuine, for it has been my experience that
when a poem is not to be found in the collected editions
of the poet it is almost certain that it is not genuine.
In justice to Freneau, who had the welfare of his
writings much at heart, and who cut and pruned and
remodeled with tireless hand, I have usually given the
latest version.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge here my great indebtedness
to the descendants of Philip Freneau, especially Miss
Adele M. Sweeney, Mr. Weymer J. Mills, Mrs. Helen
K. Vreeland, and Mrs. Eleanor F. No&euml;l, who have
allowed me to consult freely all the papers and literary
remains of the poet and have supplied me with all possible
information. I would also express my great obligation
to many librarians, collectors, and scholars, who
have cheerfully aided me, especially to Mr. Wilberforce
Eames, of the New York Public Library, the late Paul
Leicester Ford, Mr. Robert H. Kelby, of the New York
Historical Society, Mr. John W. Jordan, of the Pennsylvania
Historical Society, Mr. A. S. Salley, Jr., of
Charleston, S. C., Mr. E. M. Barton, of the American
Antiquarian Society, and Dr. E. C. Richardson, of
Princeton University, who with their courteous helpfulness
have made possible the work. I wish also to
express my thanks to Professor A. Howry Espenshade,
and Mr. John Rogers Williams, to whose careful and
patient work upon the proofs the accuracy of the text
depends.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In the possession of the Freneau descendants there
is an old French Bible, printed in Geneva, Switzerland,
in 1587, which preserves an unbroken roll of the heads
of the family back to the original owner of the book,
Philip Fresneau, who on his death-bed in La Chapelle,
France, in 1590, gave it into the hands of his eldest son.
For five generations the book remained in the little
suburban village, its possessors sturdy, industrious
tradesmen, who stood high in the esteem of their community
and yet who on account of their Protestant faith
were often imposed upon and at times even persecuted.
It was doubtless this feeling of insecurity, if not positive
persecution, which compelled Andr&eacute; Fresneau,
like so many of his fellow Huguenots, to leave his
native village and to seek a home in a more tolerant
land.</p>

<p>He landed in New York in 1707. He was in his
thirty-sixth year, an active, handsome man, almost
brilliant in certain directions, of pleasing address, and
skilled from his youth in the handling of affairs. He
became at once a leader in the little Huguenot Colony
whose center was the quaint old church "du St. Esprit"
on Pine street. He was soon in the midst of a thriving
shipping business, dealing largely in imported wines,
and in 1710, three years after his arrival, he was able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
to furnish a beautiful home on Pearl street, near Hanover
Square, for his young bride, Mary Morin, a daughter
of Pierre Morin, of the French Congregation. Of
the comfort and hospitality of this home there are many
contemporary references. John Fontaine, the French
traveller, was entertained here in 1716 and he speaks
highly of his host and his entertainment.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In 1721 Mrs. Fresneau died at the early age of
twenty-seven, leaving behind a family of five children,
the oldest only nine years of age. Four years later the
father followed. But the young family was far from
destitute. The business house in New York had grown
to be very profitable and there was a large landed estate
in eastern New Jersey, a part of which was sold in
1740. Soon the two eldest sons, Andrew, born 1712,
and Pierre, born January 22, 1718, were able to continue
their father's business. For years their firm
name was familiar in New York.</p>

<p>Pierre Freneau (the family seem to have dropped
the "s" about 1725) was married in 1748 to Agnes
Watson, daughter of Richard Watson, of Freehold,
whose property bordered upon the Freneau estate.
They made their home in Frankfort street, New
York, and here on January 2 (O. S.), 1752, was born
their eldest child, Philip Morin Freneau, the subject of
our sketch. Four other children came from their union,
of whom only one, Peter, born April 5, 1757, who in
later years became a prominent figure in Charleston,
S. C., need be mentioned.</p>

<p>The home of the Freneau's was one of comfort and
even refinement. There was a large and well selected
library, the pride of its owner. "There," he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
say to his visitors, pointing to his books, "use them
freely, for among them you will find your truest
friends." He delighted in men of refinement, and his
home became a social center for the lovers of books and
of culture. He looked carefully after the education of
his children; and all of them early became omnivorous
readers. In such an environment the young poet passed
his first ten years.</p>

<p>In 1762 the family decided to leave New York and
to make their home permanently on their estate,
"Mount Pleasant," near Middletown Point, N. J. The
estate at this time contained nearly a thousand acres,
and with its large buildings, its slaves and its broad
area under cultivation, was in many respects like a
southern plantation. Heretofore the elder Freneau
had made it of secondary importance. He had used
it as a summer resort, and as a pleasant relief to the
monotony of his city business, but now, perhaps on
account of failing health, he determined to devote to it
all of his energies. Philip was left behind in New York.
For the next three years he lived at a boarding school
in the city, going home only during the long vacations.
At the age of thirteen he was sent to the Latin school
at Penolopen, then presided over by the Rev. Alexander
Mitchell, to prepare for college.</p>

<p>The father of the family died Oct. 17, 1767. This,
however, did not disturb the plans of the eldest son,
and on Nov. 7, 1768, he entered the sophomore class at
Princeton so well prepared that President Witherspoon
is said to have sent a letter of congratulation to his
mother.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Of the college life of Philip Freneau we have only
fragmentary records. He was in his sixteenth year
when he entered, a somewhat dreamy youth who had
read very widely, especially in the English poets and
the Latin classics, and who already commanded a facile
pen, especially in the field of heroic verse. During the
year in which he entered Princeton he composed two
long poems, "The History of the Prophet Jonah," and
"The Village Merchant,"&mdash;surely notable work for the
pen of a college sophomore. During the following
year he wrote "The Pyramids of Egypt," and before
his graduation he had completed several other pieces,
some of them full of real poetic inspiration.</p>

<p>The period during which Freneau resided at Princeton
was a most significant one. In the same class with him
were James Madison, H. H. Brackenridge, the author
of "Modern Chivalry" and a conspicuous figure in
later Pennsylvania history, and Samuel Spring, who
was to become widely influential in religious circles.
In the class below him were the refined and scholarly
William Bradford and the brilliant Aaron Burr. The
shadow of the coming struggle with Great Britain was
already lengthening over the Colonies and nowhere
was its presence more manifest than in the colleges,
always the most sensitive areas in times of tyranny
and oppression. On August 6, 1770, the senior class
at Princeton voted unanimously to appear at commencement
dressed in American manufactures.</p>

<p>Another circumstance made the period a notable
one. On June 24, 1769, a little band of students,
headed by Madison, Brackenridge, Bradford and Freneau,
organized an undergraduate fraternity to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
called the American Whig Society. One year later
The Well Meaning Club, a rival literary organization
founded in 1765, became the Cliosophic Society.
The act was the signal for a war, the echoes of which
have even yet not died away at Princeton. There
exists a manuscript book,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> rescued from the papers of
William Bradford, in which are preserved the poetic
tirades, called forth in this first onset. Its title page is
as follows:</p>

<p>"Satires | against the Tories. | Written in the last
War between the Whigs &amp; Cliosophians | in which |
the former obtained a compleat Victory.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;Arm'd for virtue now we point the pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brand the bold front of shameless, guilty men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dash the proud Tory in his gilded Car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare the mean heart that hides beneath a star."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It opens with ten "pastorals" by Brackenridge, of
which the ninth begins thus:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">"Spring's Soliloquy that morning before he hung himself.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O World adieu! the doleful time draws nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot live and yet I fear to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warford is dead! and in his turn Freneau<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will send me headlong to the shades below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What raging fury or what baleful Star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did find&mdash;ingulph me in the whiggish war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of darkness which my soul hath done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are now apparent as the noon-day sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Thousand things as yet remain untold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My secret practice and my sins of old."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then follow several satires by Freneau, full of fire
and invective, but like the work of all the others, not
always refined or quotable in print. His satire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
"McSwiggen," printed in 1775, contains nearly half of the
poems,&mdash;the only lines indeed which are of any real
merit. The three concluding poems of the collection,
and these by all means the worst of the lot, are from no
less a pen than Madison's. No patriotic citizen will
ever venture to resurrect them.</p>

<p>There is a tradition very widely current that Freneau
was for a time the room-mate of Madison. However
this may be, there is no question as to who was
his most intimate friend. With Brackenridge he had
much in common. Both had dreams of a literary life,
both had read largely in polite literature, both scribbled
constantly in prose and verse. In the same manuscript
volume with the Clio-Whig satires there is an extensive
fragment of a novel written alternately by Brackenridge
and Freneau, between September 20th and October 22d,
1770. Its manuscript title page is as follows:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Father Bombo's | Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia. | Vol. II. |
Wherein is given a true account of the innumerable and | surprizing
adventures which befell him in the course of that | long and tedious
Journey, | Till he once more returned safe to his native Land, as
related | by his own mouth. | Written By B. H. and P. F.&mdash;1770.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Mutato nomine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fabula de te narratur&mdash;<i>Hor.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Change but the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The story's told of you.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">MDVIILXX."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The adventures of the hero read like chapters from
the "Arabian Nights." He has been for seven days a
close captive on a French man-of-war, but he is rescued
by an Irish privateer, only to be taken for a wizard
and thrown overboard in a cask which is finally washed
ashore on the north coast of Ireland. It would be
useless to recount all of his adventures both afloat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
ashore. He finally succeeds in reaching Mecca, and in
returning safely home to America. The final chapter
recounts the details of his death and moralizes on his
life and character.</p>

<p>The work is crude and hasty. Whole chapters of
it were evidently written at one sitting. The part
signed H. B. is unquestionably the best; the prose is
vigorous and the movement rapid. The only merit in
Freneau's section lies in its lyric lament at the close of
one of the chapters. The hero suddenly bursts into
minor song, the opening stanzas of which are:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet are the flow'rs that crown the Vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the spicy breathing Gale<br /></span>

<span class="i0">See how the distant lowing throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' verdant pastures move along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drink the Limpid Streams and crystal rills.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The Shepherd tells his tale of Love<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And clasps the wanton fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While winds and trees and shades conspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fann with Love the Gentle Fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banish every black and boding care.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But what has Love to do with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown ashore, distress'd by sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Now hast'ning to the Tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst here I rove, and pine and weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sav'd from the fury of the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find alas on shore a harder doom.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The nature of the undergraduate work done by
Princeton in Freneau's time was thus summed up by
President Witherspoon in his "Address to the Inhabitants
of Jamaica," published in Philadelphia in 1772:</p>

<p>"In the first year they read Latin and Greek, with
the Roman and Grecian antiquities, and Rhetoric. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
the second, continuing the study of the languages, they
learn a compleat system of Geography, with the use of
the globes, the first principles of Philosophy, and the
elements of mathematical knowledge. The third,
though the languages are not wholly omitted, is chiefly
employed in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.
And the senior year is employed in reading the higher
classics, proceeding in the Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy and going through a course of Moral Philosophy.
In addition to these, the President gives lectures
to the juniors and seniors, which consequently
every Student hears twice over in his course, first,
upon Chronology and History, and afterwards upon
Composition and Criticism. He has also taught the
French language last winter, and it will continue to
be taught to all who desire to learn it. * * *</p>

<p>"As we have never yet been obliged to omit or
alter it for want of scholars, there is a fixed Annual
Commencement on the last Wednesday of September,
when, after a variety of public exercises, always attended
by a vast concourse of the politest company, from the
different parts of this province and the cities of New
York and Philadelphia. * * *"</p>

<p>Of Freneau's proficiency as a student we have no
record. Of the details of the Commencement of September
25, 1771, when he received his degree, we have
but a brief account. Brackenridge opened the exercises
with a salutatory, and following came four other
exercises which completed the morning's programme.</p>

<p>The audience assembled again at three, and after
singing by the students there came:</p>

<p>"6. An English forensic dispute on this question,
'Does ancient poetry excel the modern?' Mr. Freneau,
the respondent, his arguments in favor of the ancients<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
were read. Mr. Williamson answered him and Mr.
McKnight replied."</p>

<p>"7. A poem on 'The Rising Glory of America,' by
Mr. Brackenridge, was received with great applause by
the audience."</p>

<p>Madison on account of ill health did not appear.</p>

<p>The "Rising Glory" had been written conjointly
by Brackenridge and Freneau. Although the former
was given on the Commencement programme full credit
for the exercise, it was surely Freneau who conceived
the work and who gave it its strength and high literary
value. Brackenridge in later years confessed to his
son that "on his part it was a task of labor, while the
verse of his associate flowed spontaneously." The
poem was printed in Philadelphia the following year,
and in 1786 Freneau isolated his own portion for publication
in the first edition of his works.</p>

<p>This detaching of Freneau's portion from the complete
work destroyed at the outset the original unity of
the piece. The changes and omissions made necessary
by the process of separating the part from the whole,
the deliberate readjustment of perspective to bring the
poem up to the historical conditions of the later date,
and the careful editing which strove to remove blemishes
and weaknesses due to inexperience, combine to
make the 1786 version practically a new poem.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of Freneau after his graduation
from Princeton is furnished by a letter to Madison, dated
Somerset County, in Maryland, November 22, 1772:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"If I am not wrongly informed by my memory, I have not seen
you since last April, you may recollect I was then undertaking a School
at Flatbush on Long Island. I did not enter upon the business it is

excuse it. 'Si fama non venit ad aures,'&mdash;if you have not heard the
rumour of this story (which, by the by is told in various taverns and
eating houses) you must allow me to be a little prolix with it. Those
who employed me were some gentlemen of New York, some of them
are bullies, some merchants, and others Scoundrels: They sent me
eight children, the eldest of whom was 10 years. Some could read,

me to death and by no means suits my 'giddy, wandring brain.' I
would go over for the gown this time two years, but the old hag Necessity
has got such a prodigious gripe of me that I fear I shall never be
able to accomplish it. I believe if I cannot make this out I must turn

<p>The scene of Freneau's new labors was the famous
old school near Princess Anne, Md., which in 1779
was incorporated as Washington Academy. Brackenridge
became Master here shortly after his graduation,
and in the words of his son and biographer, received
"a handsome salary." "He continued here," says his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
biographer, "during several years until the breaking out
of the American Revolution, in the midst of a wealthy
and highly polished society, greatly respected as a man
of genius and scholarship. He used to speak with
the pride of a Porson, of the Winders, the Murrays,
the Parnells and others who afterward became distinguished."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
For many years the academy drew to it
the sons of the best families of Northern Virginia,
Maryland and Delaware.</p>

<p>The length of Freneau's stay in Maryland is uncertain.
There is evidence that he remained as Second
Master of the school for several years. There is a tradition
in the family that it was the wish of Freneau's
father that he study divinity and that for a time he
joined with Brackenridge in preparing for this profession;
and there is another, which is very persistent,
that he left Maryland to study the law in Philadelphia,
but I can find no positive evidence. The period between
1772 and 1775 is at best a vague one in our life
of the poet.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In the early summer of 1775, Freneau suddenly
appeared in New York as a publicist of remarkable
fluency. Before November he had issued no less than
eight long poems as separate publications, nearly all of
them called forth by the new crisis in American affairs.
Beginning with "American Liberty," issued by Anderson,
the editor of the new patriotic weekly, <i>The Constitutional
Gazette</i>, he published pamphlet after pamphlet in
rapid succession, all of them throwing upon Gage and
the British cause in Boston all the satire and invective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
which he had used so mercilessly in the old society war
at Princeton. Two of these were published by Hugh
Gaine, and another, "The Voyage to Boston," first issued
by Anderson, was reprinted at once in Philadelphia.
All of them have fared hardly during the years.
Several, like "General Gage's Soliloquy," and "Timothy
Taurus," which recounts the story of a journey made by
Freneau to Passaic Falls, near Paterson, New Jersey,
in August, have disappeared entirely, one of them, the
"General Gage's Confession," has never been republished
in any form, and all the others were cut down
and altered by the author for later editions until they
were almost in every respect entirely new poems.</p>

<p>That these voluminous and vigorous tirades, which
their author evidently poured forth with perfect ease,
were criticised and condemned by the fastidious we
have no evidence. Certain it is that judging by the
contemporary newspaper press they were exceedingly
popular. Yet, in November we find Freneau in a sad
state of discouragement, ready to give up forever all
association with the muses. Some one, envious of his
rising fame, has criticised him unmercifully. He seeks
out the old Clio-Whig satires and after adapting and
reshaping them he hurls them at the head of his
enemy whom he designates as McSwiggen.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Freneau had determined to spend the winter in
the West Indies. He had become acquainted during
the autumn with a West Indian gentleman by the name
of Hanson, who owned large estates in the islands, and
who sailed master of his own vessel. Upon his invitation
Freneau became a passenger late in November for
the Island of Santa Cruz. Early in the voyage the
mate died, and the young poet, his education outweighing
his inexperience in nautical matters, was chosen to
fill his place. The study of navigation, made necessary
by this step, doubtless turned the direction of his
whole life.</p>

<p>For the next two years Freneau made his home on
Captain Hanson's estate on the Island of Santa Cruz.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>A selection from one of his letters charmingly describes
the spot.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The town at the west end is but mean and ordinary, consisting of
a fort and perhaps 80 or 90 wooden houses. The harbor is nothing
but an open road, where, however, ships lie in the utmost security at
their moorings, the bottom being good for anchorage and the wind
always off shore. About two miles to the eastward of this town, along
the seashore, is the estate of Capt. Hanson, into which the sea has
formed a beautiful little bay, called Buttler's Bay, about 100 yards
across; it has a sandy shore and an excellent landing, though all the
rest of the shore is sharp craggy rocks. My agreeable residence at
this place for above two years, off and on during the wars in America,
renders the idea of it all too pleasing, and makes me feel much the
same anxiety at a distance from it as Adam did after he was banished
from the bowers of Eden."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>

<p>He seems to have been employed at intervals by
Captain Hanson in voyages about the islands. Thus
he records of the Island of St. James, that "I went
over July 13, 1777, and remained there eight days.
We loaded our vessel with coral rock, which is used
in these islands for burning lime of a very excellent
quality."</p>

<p>It was while at the ideal retreat at Butler's Bay
that Freneau wrote three of his most significant poems,
"Santa Cruz," "The House of Night," and "The
Jamaica Funeral," the first two of which were contributed
to the <i>United States Magazine</i> in 1779. Of
these the "House of Night" is the most significant,
containing as it does evidence of a high creative power
and a romantic imagination, rare indeed in English
poetry in 1776. There are evidences that Freneau
composed the first draught of the poem before leaving
for the West Indies, but the point is not an important
one. For the edition of 1786 he nearly doubled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
original version, but in 1795 he cut it down to a few
stanzas, taking from it nearly everything which had
made it a notable creation.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1778, Freneau sailed from Santa Cruz
for the Bermuda Islands, where for a time he was the
guest of the English Governor. In an elaborate letter
to Brackenridge, dated Bermuda, May 10, afterward
published in the <i>United States Magazine</i>, he describes at
length the islands. "These," he says in conclusion,
"are a few particulars concerning this little country
where I resided upwards of five weeks, and if this
slight description gives you any satisfaction, it will
amply repay me for the fatigues I underwent in sailing
thither."</p>

<p>On June 6th he was again in Santa Cruz; on the
15th he set out on his homeward voyage, after an
absence of nearly three years. The run home was
destined to be eventful. Off the Delaware capes the
vessel was taken by the British, but Freneau, being a
passenger, was landed on July 9th and allowed to go
his way.</p>

<p>The young poet now retired to Mount Pleasant,
where doubtless he quietly remained until the autumn
of the following year. In August, 1778, he published
with Bell in Philadelphia the pamphlet poem "America
Independent." On January 1, 1779, Brackenridge
issued in Philadelphia the first number of the <i>United
States Magazine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Freneau at once became an important
contributor. His work in prose and verse
may be found in nearly every number. There are
prose papers on the West Indies, purporting to be
extracts from the letters of "a young philosopher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
and <i>bel esprit</i> just returned from several small voyages
amongst these islands." There are several early poems
for the first time put into print, like "Columbus to Ferdinand"
and "The Dying Elm," and there are several
notable long poems, like "Santa Cruz" and "The
House of Night." At least three of the poetical contributions
were written expressly for the magazine:
"George the Third's Soliloquy," "Psalm cxxxvii Imitated,"&mdash;signed
"Monmouth, Sept. 10,"&mdash;and the
"Dialogue between George and Fox." It is evident,
however, that Freneau, though his work very greatly
strengthened the periodical, was only a "valued contributor."
The psalm in the September issue, the first
of the poems to bear his name, had a foot-note explaining
that the author was "a young gentleman to whom
in the course of this work we are greatly indebted."</p>

<p>The <i>United States Magazine</i> is a notable landmark
in American literary history. Its methods, as we view
them to-day, seem singularly modern, and its materials
and arrangement are indeed remarkable when we view
them against the background of their times. It was a
spirited, intensely patriotic, and highly literary periodical;
the single fact that "The House of Night"
first appeared in its columns is enough to stamp it
as no ordinary work. It died with its twelfth issue,
owing to the troubled state of the country and the
unsettled nature of the currency. Then, too, the audience
to which it appealed was found to be a small one.
In his valedictory the editor complains bitterly of the
unliterary atmosphere in America. A large class, he
declares, "inhabit the region of stupidity, and cannot
bear to have the tranquility of their repose disturbed
by the villanous shock of a book. Reading is to them
the worst of all torments, and I remember very well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
that at the commencement of the work it was their
language, 'Art thou come to torment us before the
time?' We will now say to them, 'Sleep on and take
your rest.'"</p>

<p>Late in September, 1779, Freneau shipped as super-cargo
on the brig <i>Rebecca</i>, Captain Chatham, bound for
the Azores. After an exciting voyage, during which
they were several times chased by British ships, they
arrived at Santa Cruz, in the island of Teneriffe, where
they remained two months. A part of Freneau's notebook
during this voyage has been preserved. It shows
him to have been a careful and conscientious student of
navigation, making each day an observation of his own
and minutely tabulating his results. His cash account
with the crew during the stay in the islands is interesting
and suggestive.</p>

<p>The early spring of 1780 was spent by the poet at
the old home, but his mind was evidently tossing upon
the ocean. He longed to visit again his beloved West
Indies, and accordingly on the 25th of May he took
passage at Philadelphia, in the ship <i>Aurora</i>, for St.
Eustatia. Freneau's account of this voyage and its
after results is still extant.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A few quotations will
tell the story.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"On the 25th of May, in beating down the Delaware Bay, we
unfortunately retook a small sloop from the refugees loaded with corn,
which hindered us from standing out to sea that night, whereby in all
probability we should have avoided the enemy which afterwards captured
us.</p>

<p>"Friday morning, May 26. The air very smoky and the wind
somewhat faintish, though it afterward freshened up. The wind was so
that we stood off E.S.E., after putting the pilot on board the small
sloop, handcuffing the prisoners, and sending the prize to Cape May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
About three o'clock in the afternoon we discovered three sail bearing
from us about E.N.E.; they were not more than five leagues from us
when we discovered them from the foretop; at the same time we could
see them from the quarter-deck. One appeared to be a pretty large
ship, the other two brigs. We soon found they were in chase of us;
we therefore tacked immediately, set all sail we could crowd, and stood
back from the bay. My advice to the officers was to stand for Egg
Harbor or any part of the Jersey shore, and run the ship on the flats,
rather than be taken; but this was disregarded. We continued to stand
in till we saw Cape Henlopen; the frigate, in the meantime, gaining on
us apace; sun about half an hour high. We were abreast of the Cape,
close in, when the wind took us aback, and immediately after we were
becalmed; the ebb of the tide at the same time setting very strong out
of the bay, so that we rather drifted out. Our design was, if possible,
to get within the road around the point, and then run the ship on shore;
but want of wind and the tide being against us, hindered from putting
this into execution. We were now within three hundred yards of the
shore. The frigate in the meantime ran in the bay to leeward of us
about one-quarter of a mile (her distance from the Cape hindering it
from becalming her as it did us) and began to bring her cannon to bear
on us. Her two prizes hove to; one we knew to be the brig <i>Active</i>,
Captain Mesnard; the other, as we afterward learned, was a Salem brig
from the West Indies. The frigate was the <i>Iris</i>, returning from
Charleston to New York, with the express of the former's being taken.
We now began to fire upon each other at the distance of about three
hundred yards. The frigate hulled us several times. One shot went
betwixt wind and water, which made the ship leak amazingly, making
twenty-four inches in thirty minutes. We found our four-pounders were
but trifles against the frigate, so we got our nine-pounder, the only one
we had, pointed from the cabin windows, with which we played upon
the frigate for about half an hour. At last a twelve-pound shot came
from the frigate, and, striking a parcel of oars lashed upon the starboard
quarter, broke them all in two, and continuing its destructive course,
struck Captain Laboyteaut in the right thigh, which it smashed to
atoms, tearing part of his belly open at the same time with the splinters
from the oars; he fell from the quarter-deck close by me, and for some
time seemed very busily engaged in setting his legs to rights. He died
about eleven the same night, and next day was sewed up in his hammock
and sunk. Every shot seemed now to bring ruin with it. A lad
named Steel had his arm broken and some others complained of slight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
wounds; whereupon, finding the frigate ready and in a position to give
us a broadside, we struck, after having held a very unequal contest with
her for about an hour.... As soon as we struck, one Squires with
some midshipmen came on board and took possession of the vessel."</p></div>

<p>Freneau at first supposed that, being a passenger,
he would be taken with the prize to New York and
there released; but despite his protests, he was driven
into the barge with the other prisoners and taken to
the <i>Iris</i>. All his baggage was left behind, and he was
destined never to see it again. Arriving on board, the
prisoners were driven between decks, where the air
was hot and stifling.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"There were about one hundred prisoners forward, the stench of
whom was almost intolerable. So many melancholy sights and dismal
countenances made it a pretty just representation of the infernal region.
I marched through a torrent of cursing and blasphemy to my station,
viz., at the blacksmith's vice, where the miserable prisoners were handcuffed
two and two. At last it came my turn. 'Pray,' said I, 'is it
your custom to handcuff passengers? The Americans, I am confident,
never used the English so.'</p>

<p>"'Are you a passenger?' said the blacksmith. At the same time
happening to look up, I saw Hugh Ray looking steadily at me, who
immediately seized my hand, and asked me how I did. 'Do you know
him?' said Holmes, the master-at-arms. 'Then you are free from
irons; come over among the gentlemen.'</p>

<p>"This was an unexpected deliverance from a cursed disgrace which
I hardly knew how I should get clear of. After this I was used well by
everybody."</p></div>

<p>On the 29th the <i>Iris</i> reached New York and the
common prisoners were sent to the prison ships in the
harbor. Freneau, however, was retained with the officers.
He had been promised his liberty at the first
possible moment, but on Thursday, June 1st, at the
Commissioner's office, the charge was brought by the
second mate that Freneau had been among those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
stationed at the guns during the fight. He was refused
parole, though he promised security in any amount up
to ten thousand pounds, and the same day was placed
on board the <i>Scorpion</i> prison ship, "lying off the college
in the North River."</p>

<p>Freneau's experiences during his stay upon the
<i>Scorpion</i> have been described by him in graphic style in
his poem, "The Prison Ship."</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"On the night of June 4th, thirty-five of the prisoners formed a
design of making their escape, in which they were favored by a large
schooner accidentally alongside of us. She was one that was destined
for the expedition to Elizabeth Town, and anchored just astern of us.
We were then suffered to continue upon deck, if we chose, till nine
o'clock. We were all below at that time except the insurgents, who
rushed upon the sentries and disarmed them in a moment; one they tied
by his neck-stock to the quarter rails, and carried off his musquet with
them (they were all Hessians); the rest they drove down with their arms
into the cabin and rammed the sentry box down the companion in such
a manner that no one could get it up or down. One, Murphy, possessed
himself of Gauzoo's silver-hilted sword, and carried it off with
him. When the sentries were all silent, they manned the ship's boat
and boarded the schooner, though the people on board attempted to
keep them off with handspikes. The wind blowing fresh at south and
the flood of tide being made, they hoisted sail and were out of sight in
a few minutes. Those particulars we learned from some who were on
duty, but were unsuccessful in getting into the boat. As soon as the
sentries got possession of the vessel again, which they had no difficulty
in doing, as there was no resistance made, they posted themselves at
each hatchway and most basely and cowardly fired fore and aft among
us, pistols and musquets, for a full quarter of an hour without intermission.
By the mercy of God they touched but four, one mortally.... After
this no usage seemed severe enough for us."</p></div>

<p>On June 22d, Freneau, who was weak with fever,
was taken to the <i>Hunter</i> hospital ship, lying in the East
River. Here he languished with an intermittent fever,
that threatened constantly to become "putrid" and
fatal, until July 12th, when:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The flag came alongside and cleared the hospital ship. But the
miseries we endured in getting to Elizabeth Town were many. Those
that were very bad, of which the proportion was great, naturally took
possession of the hold. No prisoner was allowed to go to the cabin, so
that I, with twenty or thirty others, were obliged to sleep out all night,
which was uncommonly cold for the season. About ten next morning
we arrived at Elizabeth Town Point, where we were kept in the burning
sun several hours, till the Commissary came to discharge us.</p>

<p>"I was afflicted with such pains in my joints, I could scarcely walk,
and besides was weakened with a raging fever; nevertheless I walked
two miles to Elizabeth Town; here I got a passage in a wagon to within
a mile of Crow's Ferry, which I walked; got a passage over the ferry
and walked on as far as Molly Budleigh's, where I stayed all night.
Next morning, having breakfasted on some bread and milk, I set homeward;
when I came to Obadiah Budleigh's corner I turned to the right
and came home round about through the woods, for fear of terrifying
the neighbors with my ghastly looks had I gone through Mount
Pleasant."</p></div>

<p>Some days later he despatched the following note
to his friend at Santa Cruz:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I take this opportunity to inform you that instead of arriving,
as I fondly promised myself, at the fragrant groves and delectable
plains of Santa Cruz, to enjoy the fruits and flowers of that happy clime,
I was unfortunately taken and confined on board a prison ship at New
York, and afterwards in a Hospital Ship, where the damnable draughts
of a German doctor afforded far different feelings to my stomach than
the juice of the orange or more nourishing milk of the cocoa."</p></div>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>On April 25, 1781, there was established in Philadelphia
a new weekly newspaper, the <i>Freeman's Journal
or North American Intelligencer</i>, which was to be "open
to all parties but influenced by none," and which had
for its object "To encourage genius, to deter vice, and
disrobe tyranny and misrule of every plumage." The
proprietor and printer of this paper was Mr. Francis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
Bailey, who not long before had removed his office
from Lancaster, Pa. The editor and ruling spirit,
although his name during three years did not once
appear in its columns, was Philip Freneau. The mark
of the young poet is upon every page. Its opening
editorial, which was from his pen, sounded a note that
was not once lowered or weakened while he was in
control.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"At no period of time, in no era of important events from the first
establishment of social government, have the liberties of man, have the
rights even of human nature, been more deeply interested than at the
time in which we presume to address you. While Liberty, the noblest
ornament of society, and without which no community can be well
organized, seemed to pine and sicken under the trammels of despotic
restraint in every one of the ancient nations of the earth, it fairly promises
to resume its pristine majesty here, and the new world begins to
emerge from the fangs and tyranny of the old.... One of the first
sources of her decline in those countries where she last resided spring
from the wanton and unhallowed restraints which the jealous arm of
despotism hath imposed on the freedom of the press....</p>

<p>"That freemen may be made acquainted with the real state of
their affairs, and that the characters of their public servants, both individually
and collectively, be made manifest, is our object. With this
patriotic view, and under the tutelage of law and the constitution, has
the subscriber opened a Free Press, universally free to every citizen
indiscriminately, whose principles coincide with those of the Revolution,
and whose object is confessedly known to point at public or private
good."</p></div>

<p>From this time until June, 1784, Freneau resided
principally in Philadelphia, and edited the journal.
During all of this time his muse was exceedingly active.
He followed carefully the last years of the war, and
put into satiric verse every movement of the "insolent
foe." He sang the victory of Jones, and mourned in
plaintive numbers the dead at Eutaw Springs. He
voiced his indignation over the destructive career of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
Cornwallis, and burst into a <i>Laus Deo</i> at his fall. The
ludicrous plight of Rivington and Gaine, the distress of
the Tories, and the final departure of the British filled
him with glee, which he poured out in song after song.
It was his most prolific and spontaneous period.</p>

<p>He wrote, too, an abundance of prose. The series
of graceful papers entitled "The Pilgrim" is from his
pen, besides many a political study and literary sketch
signed with a sounding name. Everywhere are manifest
his love of true literature and his desire to lead a
merely literary life, but here and there are notes of
discouragement. "Barbers cannot possibly exist as
such," he writes, "among a people who have neither
hair nor beards. How, then, can a poet hope for
success in a city where there are not three persons
possessed of elegant ideas?"</p>

<p>During the year 1783 Freneau's pen was very busy
in various lines of work. It is probable that he assisted
Bailey in many ways,&mdash;writing introductions to publications
issued by the office and performing the various
other duties incumbent upon the literary editor of a
publishing house. During this year he translated the
"New Travels through North America," which had
just been issued by the Abb&eacute; Robin, one of the chaplains
of the French Army in America, and the translation
was issued first by Bailey and later by Powers
and Willis of Boston. Freneau's introduction is characteristic:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Most of those accounts of North America, given to the public by
British explorators and others, previous to the Revolution, are generally
taken up, with the recitals of wonderful adventures, in the woods beyond
the Lakes, or with the Histories and records of the wild Indian nations,
so that by the time the reader gets through one of those performances,
he never fails to be better acquainted with the <i>Ottagnies</i>, <i>Chereokees</i>,
<i>Miamees</i>, <i>Nadouwessians</i>, and a hundred others, with their various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
customs of <i>paw-wawing</i>, or methods of making <i>wampum</i>, than with the
most interesting particulars relative to the <i>inhabitants</i> of the then colonies
<i>these</i> were but rarely thought worthy mentioning by those gentlemen,
and when they are, it is mortifying enough to see them constantly
considered as mere beasts of burden, calculated solely for the support of
the grandeur, wealth and omnipotence of Great-Britain, than as men
and Free-Men.</p>

<p>"Our French Author is more liberal&mdash;two years before the present
peace he considered the United States as a great independent nation,
advancing with hasty strides to the summit of power and sovereignty."</p></div>

<p>It was during this year that the poet, for the first
time, met with positive opposition and abuse. Oswald,
the editor of the newly established <i>Gazette</i>, quarrelled
with Bailey, and a poetical battle was one phase of
the contest. The details of this affair will be found
in the proper place, and I need not recount them here,
but suffice it to say that Freneau soon found his muse
assailed by the meanest of all critics. His extremely
sensitive nature could brook no criticism. His Celtic
temperament could fight fiercely in the presence of an
open foe, but it was easily depressed and discouraged
by criticism and covert attack. He lost heart in his
work, and at the end of the third volume he quietly
withdrew from his editorship.</p>

<p>The three volumes of the <i>Journal</i> which bear his
impress are notable for their vigor of policy, their high
ideals, their unswerving patriotism, and their real literary
merit. It is to be hoped that a selection from
Freneau's prose writings during this critical era in our
history may sometime be made. Nowhere else can
we gain so distinct a picture of the man, with his sanguine,
impetuous temperament, his proud spirit, and
his intense hatred of every form of tyranny. He
wrote vigorously not only on British oppression, but
on such topics as the wrongs of negro slavery, cruelty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
to animals, the wanton destruction of trees, the evils
of intemperance, and the rights of woman.</p>

<p>The "Epistle to Sylvius" was his valedictory. In
it he deplores the lack of literary taste in America, and
the sad fate which has befallen his youthful poetic
dreams. The age is grown mercantile, and Sejanus
the mighty tradesman,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sejanus has in house declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'These States, as yet, can boast no bard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the sing-song of our clime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is merely nonsense fringed with rhyme.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A bard with more Teutonic blood, if he knew
within himself that he was indeed a poet, and the only
real poet of his time, would have staid at his post and
made himself heard, despite narrow criticism and mean
abuse, but Freneau was too proud to fight for recognition.
The people had crowned him, to be sure, but
if the critics, those who should be the real judges,
rejected him, he would strive no longer. He would
leave the field.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then, Sylvius, come&mdash;let you and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Neptune's aid, once more rely:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The balm to ease the aching heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though cold might chill and storms dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Zoilus will be far away."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On June 24, 1784, Freneau sailed from Middletown
Point as master of the brig <i>Dromilly</i>, bound for
Jamaica. The voyage was indeed a memorable one.
On the night of July 30, while off the end of the island,
the ship encountered a violent hurricane. According
to contemporary accounts, "No more than eight out
of one hundred and fifty sail of vessels in the ports of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
Kingston and Port Royal were saved." The <i>Dromilly</i>
survived the storm, but it was a mere wreck when the
next morning it crept into Kingston Harbor.</p>

<p>Freneau remained in Jamaica until September 24,
when he left for Philadelphia in the brig <i>Mars</i>, arriving
November 4. His experiences in trying to fit out the
wrecked <i>Dromilly</i> are not recorded, but the one incident
of his poetic reply to the keeper of the King's
water works, who had refused him a puncheon of
water, is characteristic.</p>

<p>From this time until 1790, Freneau's life is redolent
of the ocean. A complete itinerary of this wandering
era may be compiled from the shipping news of
the various seaport newspapers, but it is useless to
go into details. He was master for a time of the sloop
<i>Monmouth</i>, plying for freight between Charleston, S. C.,
New York, and Savannah. His brother Peter, in
Charleston, had become a man not only of influence,
but of means, and together they owned the vessel and
shared its profits. For several years advertisements
like this appeared in the Charleston papers:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"For freight to any part of this State or Georgia; for charter in
any free port in the West Indies, the sloop <i>Monmouth</i>, Philip Freneau,
Master, burden about 40 tons. She is new, stanch, well-formed and
draws six feet when loaded. Will carry about one hundred barrels of
rice. For further particulars inquire of said master on board at Mrs.
Motte's wharf or Peter Freneau."</p></div>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1786, there was issued from
Bailey's press the first collected edition of Freneau's
poetry. During the entire year its author was at sea
almost continuously. It is evident that he had little to
do with the edition. The copy furnished to Bailey consisted
of the manuscript of a few early poems, revised
copies of the 1775 pamphlets, and corrected and enlarged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
versions of his contributions to the <i>United States Magazine</i>.
The bulk of the book is made up of Freneau's
contributions to the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, printed <i>seriatim</i>
and without change. The poem "Rivington's Confessions"
is even divided into two parts, with another
poem between, as it first appeared in the paper. An
index of the poetry in the first four volumes of the
<i>Journal</i> is a nearly perfect index of the 1786 edition,
after the poem "The Prison Ship."</p>

<p>Bailey wrote for the edition the following introduction:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The pieces now collected and printed in the following sheets, were
left in my hands, by the author, above a year ago, with permission to
publish them whenever I thought proper. A considerable number of the
performances contained in this volume, as many will recollect, have
appeared at different times in Newspapers (particularly the Freeman's
Journal) and other periodical publications in the different States of
America, during the late war, and since; and from the avidity and
pleasure with which they generally appear to have been read by persons
of the best taste, the Printer now the more readily gives them to the
world in their present form, (without troubling the reader with any
affected apologies for their supposed or real imperfections) in hopes
they will afford a high degree of satisfaction to the lovers of poetical
wit, and elegance of expression."</p></div>

<p>This edition is the most spontaneous and poetic of
the poet's works. In it we see Freneau before he has
lost his early poetic dream, before he has become hardened
by close contact with the world of affairs and the
cold, practical round of political life. This and the
1788 edition contain by far the most valuable part of
his poetic work.</p>

<p>In those days before the invention of book reviews,
the fate of a book turned largely upon its immediate
reception by the reading public. Criticism was by
word of mouth: the poems were discussed in polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
circles and over the morning coffee. Thus we have
nothing to quote to show how America received her
bard. We know, however, that the poems were successful
even beyond Bailey's expectations. In less
than five months he was out with proposals for "an
additional collection of entertaining original performances
in prose and verse by Philip Freneau." The
book was to be published as soon as five hundred subscribers
could be secured, and the subscribers' names
were to be printed at the beginning of the volume.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Such persons as are disposed to encourage American authors
(particularly at a time when we are surfeited with stale publications
retailed to us from British presses) and are not unwilling to be known
as promoters of polite literature and the fine arts in these Republican
States are requested to deliver in their names."</p></div>

<p>One bit of contemporary praise, however, has been
preserved. On June 8th, one week after the appearance
of Freneau's first volume, Col. Parke of Philadelphia
composed the following, which was first published
in the <i>Journal</i> of June 21st, and afterward included in
his volume of "The Lyric Works of Horace, ... to
which are added a Number of Original Poems," issued
later in the year:</p>

<p>The second volume of poems did not appear
promptly. One year after the first proposals, Bailey
advertised that the book was at last in press. "An
unusual hurry of other business (of a nature not to be
postponed), has unavoidably delayed the printer in its
publication to so late a period." It is notable that
of the four hundred and sixty-three subscribers, two
hundred and fifty, or over half, were in Charleston,
S. C., and one hundred and twenty-six in New York.
Philadelphia subscribed for very few of the volumes.</p>

<p>The printer's advertisement was as follows:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The following Essays and Poems, selected from some printed and
manuscript papers of Mr. Freneau, are now presented to the public
of the United Slates in hopes they will prove at least equally acceptable
with his volume of poems published last year. Some few of the pieces
in this volume have heretofore appeared in American newspapers; but
through a fatality, not unusually attending publications of that kind, are
now, perhaps, forgotten; and, at any time, may possibly never have
been seen or attended to but by very few."</p></div>

<p>Of the forty-nine poems in the volume, one, "Slender's
Journey," had been published separately by Bailey
early in 1787, and nearly half of the others had first
seen the light between April, 1786, and January, 1788,
in the columns of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. The greater
number of the others were doubtless printed from the
poet's manuscripts. A few of the prose papers, like
"The Philosopher of the Forest," were selected from
the columns of the <i>Journal</i>, especially from the series
entitled "The Pilgrim," but much of the rest was from
the poet's manuscripts now first published.</p>

<p>In the meantime the poet was leading a stormy
and adventurous career upon the sea. As master of
the sloop <i>Industry</i>, and later of the schooner <i>Columbia</i>,
plying irregularly on all kinds of coastwise voyages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
between Georgia and New York, he experienced every
phase of life upon the ocean. As a sample of his
adventurous career during this period, note the following
letter<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to Bailey, written from Norfolk, Va., in the
summer of 1788:</p>

<p>"I have the mortification to inform you that, after leaving New-York
on the 21st of July, I had the misfortune to have my vessel dismasted,
thrown on her beam ends, shifted and ruined the bulk of her
cargo, lost every sail, mast, spar, boat, and almost every article upon
deck, on the Wednesday afternoon following, in one of the hardest gales
that ever blew upon this coast. Capt. William Cannon, whom I think
you know, who was going passenger with me to Charleston, and Mr.
Joseph Stillwell, a lad of a reputable family in New-Jersey, were both
washed overboard and drowned, notwithstanding every effort to save
them. All my people besides, except one, an old man who stuck fast in
one of the scuttles, were several times overboard, but had the fortune to
regain the wreck, and with considerable difficulty save their lives.&mdash;As
to myself, I found the vessel no longer under any guidance&mdash;I took
refuge in the main weather shrouds, where indeed I saved myself from
being washed into the sea, but was almost staved to pieces in a violent
fall I had upon the main deck, the main-mast having given way six feet
above the deck, and gone overboard&mdash;I was afterward knocked in the
head by a violent stroke of the tiller, which entirely deprived me of sensation
for (I was told) near a quarter of an hour.&mdash;Our pumps were now
so choaked with corn that they would no longer work, upward of four
feet of water was in the hold, fortunately our bucket was saved, and
with this we went to baling, which alone prevented us from foundering
in one of the most dismal nights that ever man witnessed.</p>

<p>"The next morning the weather had cleared away and the wind
came round to the N. E. which during the gale had been E. N. E.&mdash;the
land was then in sight, about 5 miles distant, latitude at noon 36-17, I
then rigged out a broken boom, and set the fore top-sail, the only sail
remaining, and steered for cape Henry; making however but very little
way, the vessel being very much on one side and ready to sink with her
heavy cargo of iron, besides other weighty articles.   We were towed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
next day, Friday, by the friendly assistance of capt. Archibald Bell, of
the ship Betsey, from London&mdash;I have since arrived at this port by the
assistance of a Potowmac pilot.&mdash;Nothing could exceed our distress&mdash;no
fire, no candle, our beds soaked with sea water, the cabbin torn to
pieces, a vast quantity of corn damaged and poisoning us to death, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. As we entered this port, on the 29th of July, the very dogs
looked at us with an eye of commiseration&mdash;the negros pitied us, and
almost every one shewed a disposition to relieve us. In the midst of all
this vexation the crew endeavoured to keep up their spirits with a little
grog, while I have recourse to my old expedient of philosophy and
reflection. I have unloaded my cargo, partly damaged, partly otherwise&mdash;This
day I also begin to refit my vessel, and mean to proceed
back to New-York as soon as refitted, which cannot be sooner than the
25th, perhaps the 30th of this month. It is possible, however, that I
may be ordered to sell the vessel here; if so, I shall take a passage to
Baltimore, and go to New-York by the way of Philadelphia, to look out
for another more fortunate barque than that which I now command.</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Philip Freneau</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot forbear quoting another letter<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> written
nearly a year later, since it gives us a charming glimpse
of the Freneau of this period:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p class="ralign">"Yamacraw, Savanna, March 14th, 1789.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Amongst a number of my good natured acquaintance, who
have lately sympathized with me, on account of what they term my misfortunes,
during great part of last year, I know of no one more entitled
to my acknowledgments, on the occasion, than yourself. When an old
woman talks of witches, ghosts, or blue devils, we naturally make an
allowance for bad education, or the imbicility of intellect, occasioned
by age. When one man seriously supposes another unfortunate, for the
sake of two or three successive disasters, which no prudence or foresight
could have avoided, the same allowance ought to be made, provided the
same excuses could be assigned.</p>

<p>"Can you be serious, then in advising me to quit all future intercourse
with an element, that has for some years, with all its dangers and
losses, afforded to your humble servant attractions, far more powerful
than those of Apollo! Formerly, when I wrote poetry, most of those
that attended to it, would not allow my verses to be good. I gave credit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
to what I deemed the popular opinion, and made a safe retreat in due
time, to the solitary wastes of Neptune. I am not, however, inclined to
believe people so readily now, when they alledge my vessel is not sound,
and when several gentlemen, for reasons best known to themselves, and
perhaps not over willing to risque the uncertainties of the world to come,
effect to doubt of her ability to waft their carcases in safety.</p>

<p>But my ambition is greatly concerned in this matter: a schooner is
confided to my care, humble, indeed, when compared to those lofty piles
which I have seen you so much admire, but which is, nevertheless, really
capable of an European, nay of an India voyage. Read all history,
ransack libraries, call tradition to your aid, search all records, examine a
million of manuscripts on vellum, on parchment, on paper, on marble,
on what you please, and I defy you to find the most distant hint of any
<i>poet</i>, in any age or country, from Hesiod down to Peter Pindar, having
been trusted with the controul or possession of anything fit to be mentioned
or compared with the same barque, which you say, <i>I have the
misfortune to command.</i></p>

<p>"To be serious: misfortune ought to be only the topic of such men
as do not think or reason with propriety, upon the nature of things.
Some writer says, it is but another name for carelessness or inattention:
Though that may not at all times be the case, it is in the power of every
man to place himself beyond the supposed baneful influence of this inexorable
deity, by <i>assuming</i> a dignity of mind, (if it be not the gift of
nature) that will, in the end, get the better of the untoward events, that
may frequently cross our best purposes. Indeed, the <i>sea</i> is the <i>best</i> school for philosophy (I mean of the moral kind); in thirteen or fourteen
years' acquaintance with this element, I am convinced a man ought
to imbibe more of your right genuine <i>stoical</i> stuff, than could be gained
in half a century on shore.&mdash;I must add that, be our occupations what
they may, or our fortunes what they will, there is a certain delectable,
inexpressible satisfaction in now and then encountering the rubs and
disasters of life, and I am entirely of the opinion which (says Dr.
Langhorne)</p>

</div></div>

<p>"I must now conclude this scrawl, with telling you, that I am receiving
on board my vessel a small cargo of lumber, at a place called
Yamacraw, a little above Savanna. The weather is extremely warm,
I am tired of my letter, and must, of course, conclude. I do not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
whether you ever mean to make a voyage to sea&mdash;if you should, thrice
welcome shall you be to such accommodations as my little embarkation
affords. Poets and philosophers, shall ever travel with me at a cheap
rate indeed! Not only because they are not generally men of this world,
but because, even supposing the barque that bears them, should make
an external exit to the bottom of the ocean, the busy world, as things
go, will regret the loss of most of them very little, perhaps not at all.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 24th of April, 1789, when Washington
arrived in New York to enter upon the duties of the
presidency, in the fleet that accompanied him from
Elizabethtown Point was the schooner <i>Columbia</i>, Capt.
Freneau, eight days from Charleston. In June the
<i>Columbia</i> again entered New York Harbor, and on
December 28th she was at Sunbury, Georgia. On
February 12th, 1790, Freneau arrived in New York,
passenger from Middletown Point in the brig <i>Betsy</i>,
Capt. Motley, to become editor of Child and Swaine's
<i>New York Daily Advertiser</i>. For several months negotiations
had been pending. Every appearance of the
poet in New York for a year past had been marked by
a small budget of poems in the <i>Advertiser</i> from the pen
of "Capt. Freneau," but it was not until February,
1790, that he was induced to leave his beloved <i>Columbia</i>
and settle down to a life upon shore. The poem
"Neversink," written some months later, is his valedictory
to the ocean.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>The poem "Constantia" may record the poet's
reasons for leaving the ocean, for on the 19th of May,
1790, there appeared in Peter Freneau's Charleston
paper, the <i>City Gazette</i>, <i>or the Daily Advertiser</i>, the
following:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<i>Married</i>, on the fifteenth of April, at Middletown Point, East
New Jersey, Capt. Philip Freneau to Miss Eleanor Forman, daughter of
Mr. Samuel Forman, of that place."</p></div>

<p>The Forman family with which the poet allied himself
was one of great respectability and even prominence
in New Jersey. Its record during the Revolution
had been a conspicuous one, and its connection
included the Ledyards, the Seymours, and many other
prominent families. Mrs. Freneau, in the words of her
daughter, "was remarkable for her gentle, lady-like
manners, amiable disposition and finely informed mind.
She was affable and sprightly in her conversation, and
there were, even when she had reached the advanced
age of eighty-seven, few handsomer women." In her
early years she dabbled a little in poetry herself, and
there is a tradition in the family that the prenuptial
correspondence was for a long time wholly in verse.</p>

<p>Freneau was now fairly settled in life, and for the
next seven or eight years he was engaged almost continuously
in newspaper work.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>During the next year and more Freneau, as editor
of the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, brought to bear upon the paper
all the vigor and literary skill which had so marked
the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. The tone of the editorial comment
was patriotic and spirited. The note of reform,
of opposition to everything that was degrading to high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
ideals, or that in any way threatened personal liberty,
was never absent. Despite the manifold duties incumbent
upon the editor of a city daily, he found time
to write finished prose sketches and to woo the muses.
His poetry of this period is notable both as to quantity
and quality. Some of it was drawn from the notebooks
of his years of wandering, but the greater part
dealt with more timely topics. In June he published
the advertisement:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Mr. Freneau proposes publishing a volume of original poems, to
contain about two hundred and fifty pages, 12mo, neatly printed....
As soon as there appears a sufficiency of subscribers to defray the
expenses of paper and printing, the collection shall be put to press."</p></div>

<p>Judging from several poems of this period which
were printed as from the author's new volume, "The
Rising Empire," this was to be the title of the book.
The advertisement was dropped in October, and "The
Rising Empire" never appeared, though most of its
poems were printed in the edition of 1795.</p>

<p>On September 20, 1791, Freneau's daughter, Eleanor,
was born at Mount Pleasant. His salary as editor
of the <i>Advertiser</i> was not large; the little family, it
appears, was in straightened circumstances. A letter<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
from Aedanus Burke of Charleston to Madison, dated
September 13, 1801, throws light upon the period.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I remember, it was about the last fortnight that we served together
in Congress, in 1791, I one day called you aside, and mentioned the name
of Mr. Phillip Freneau to you, as one I knew you esteemed, and then lay
strugling under difficulties, with his family. My memory brings to my
recollection, that you mentioned the matter to the Secretary of State,
Mr. Jefferson. Freneau was invited from N. York, and had the place
of interpreter, with a mere trifle of Salary. Little did William Smith
know, that you were the author or cause of bringing Freneau from New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
York; or he might have turned against you, his terrible battery of the
slanders and invectives which he poured forth against Mr. Jefferson for
three or four years afterwards."</p></div>

<p>Madison acted promptly. On the 28th of February,
1791, Jefferson wrote to Freneau as follows:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The clerkship for foreign languages in my office is vacant
the salary indeed is very low, being but two hundred &amp; fifty dollars a
year; but also it gives so little to do as not to interfere with any other
calling the person may chuse, which would not absent him from the
seat of government. I was told a few days ago that it might perhaps
be convenient to you to accept it&mdash;if so, it is at your service. It
requires no other qualification than a moderate knowledge of the French.
Should anything better turn up within my department that might suit
you, I should be very happy to bestow it as well. Should you conclude
to accept the present, you may consider it as engaged to you, only be so
good as to drop me a line informing me of your resolution. I am with
great esteem, Sir, Your very humble serv't,</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Th. Jefferson</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Freneau's letter in reply has been lost. On May
1st, however, Madison wrote Jefferson, so that we may
gather its import:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I have seen Freneau also and given him a line to you. He sets
out for Philada. today or tomorrow, though it is not improbable that he
may halt in N. Jersey. He is in the habit, I find, of translating the Leyden
<i>Gazette</i> and consequently must be fully equal to the task you have
alloted for him. He had supposed that besides this degree of skill, it
might be expected that he should be able to translate with equal propriety
into French: and under this idea, his delicacy had taken an
insuperable objection to the undertaking. Being now set right as to
this particular and being made sensible of the advantages of Philada.
over N. Jersey for his private undertaking, his mind is taking another
turn; and if the scantiness of his capital should not be a bar, I think
he will establish himself in the former. At all events he will give his
friends there an opportunity of aiding his decision by their information
&amp; counsel. The more I learn of his character, talents and principles,
the more I should regret his burying himself in the obscurity
he had chosen in N. Jersey. It is certain that there is not to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
found in the whole catalogue of American Printers, a single name that
can approach towards a rivalship."</p></div>

<p>Jefferson replied on May 9th:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Your favor of the 1st came to hand on the 3d. Mr. Freneau has
not followed it. I suppose therefore he has changed his mind back
again, for which I am really sorry."</p></div>

<p>That Jefferson had made overtures to Freneau
about the establishing of a paper at the seat of government,
or at least had discussed the matter with those
who had, is evident from the following letter written
to his son-in-law, Randolph, six days later:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I enclose you Bache's as well as Fenno's papers. You will have
perceived that the latter is a paper of pure Toryism, disseminating the
doctrines of Monarchy, aristocracy, &amp; the exclusion of the people. We
have been trying to get another <i>weekly</i> or <i>half weekly</i> set up, excluding
advertisements, so that it might go through the states &amp; furnish a <i>whig
vehicle</i> of intelligence. We hoped at one time to have persuaded
Freneau to set up here, but failed."</p></div>

<p>It is a testimonial to the energy and the ability of
Freneau that leaders like Madison and Jefferson should
have sought him so persistently. Notwithstanding
Freneau's refusal, Jefferson, on July 21st, wrote to
Madison:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I am sincerely sorry that Freneau has declined coming here.
Tho' the printing business be sufficiently full here, yet I think he would
have set out on such advantageous ground as to have been sure of
success. His own genius in the first place is so superior to that of his
competitors. I should have given him the perusal of all my letters of
foreign intelligence &amp; all foreign newspapers; the publication of all
proclamations &amp; other public notices within my department, &amp; the
printing of the laws, which added to his salary would have been a considerable
aid. Besides this, Fenno's being the only weekly, or half
weekly paper, &amp; under general condemnation for its toryism &amp; its
incessant efforts to overturn the government, Freneau would have found
that ground as good as unoccupied."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span></p>

<p>This being brought to Freneau's attention, he
determined to hold out no longer. On July 25th he
wrote to Madison from Middletown Point:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Some business detains me here a day or two longer from returning
to New York. When I come, which I expect will be on Thursday,
if you should not have left the City, I will give you a decisive answer
relative to printing my paper at the Seat of Govt. instead of in N.
York. If I can get Mr. Childs to be connected with me on a tolerable
plan, I believe I shall sacrifice other considerations and transfer myself
to Philadelphia."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Francis Childs, who was one of the proprietors
of the <i>Advertiser</i>, as we have already seen, agreed
to the enterprise, and the following document was soon
signed:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p class="noidt">"<span class="smcap">Department of State of the United States.</span></p>

<p>"Philip Freneau is hereby appointed Clerk for foreign languages in
the office of Secretary of State with a salary of two hundred &amp; fifty
dollars a year, to commence from the time he shall take the requisite
oaths of qualification. Given under my hand and seal this 16th day of
August 1791.</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Th. Jefferson.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>I have considered this episode somewhat minutely
since it throws light upon what follows.</p>

<p>The first number of <i>The National Gazette</i> appeared
on Monday, October 31st. It was issued Mondays and
Thursdays. Its typography and arrangement were
neat and attractive; its news columns were well filled,
and its literary department was carefully attended to.
Its success was all that had been predicted by Madison.
On May 7, 1792, the editor announced that the subscription
to the <i>Gazette</i> had succeeded beyond his most
sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>The period covered by the two years of the
<i>National Gazette</i> was one of singular unrest in America.
The French Revolution was in progress; everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
seemed tottering. America believed that all Europe
was soon to cast off its chains of monarch; she believed
that the torch of the Rights of Man had been lighted
in America, and she looked with almost paternal interest
on the progress of the Revolution. In his poetical
salutatory in the first number of the <i>Gazette</i>, Freneau
writes:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From the spark that we kindled, a flame has gone forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To astonish the world and enlighten mankind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a code of new doctrines the universe rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paine is addressing strange sermons to Kings."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The columns of the <i>Gazette</i> are full of ringing
words on the Rights of Man, the Age of Reason, the
final doom of monarchy. In poem after poem the
editor pours out his sympathy for republicanism and
the cause of the French insurgents. That the French
had been largely instrumental in the gaining of our
own independence, increased the interest. "On the
Fourteenth of July," "On the French Republicans,"
"On the Anniversary of the Storming of the Bastile,"
"Ode to Liberty," and "Demolition of the French
Monarchy," are a few of the poems that Freneau poured
forth during this incendiary period. It is significant
that he included none of these verses in his edition of
1809. That he was honest to the core in his belief
cannot for a moment be doubted. His impulsive Celtic
temperament threw his whole soul into his work.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! while I write, dear France allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My ardent wish I scarce restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw these sybil leaves aside<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And fly to join you on the main."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The frenzy among the American Republicans culminated
with the arrival of Citizen Genet, in 1793.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
At the Republican dinner given Genet, May 18th,
Citizen Freneau was elected by acclamation to translate
Pichon's ode. On June 1st, at the civic feast,
Freneau's ode, "God Save the Rights of Man," was
received with thunderous applause.</p>

<p>One must study carefully this incendiary period
of Freneau's life before he can understand fully the
much discussed episode of the <i>National Gazette</i>. The
wine of French Republicanism was sadly intoxicating.
It could make Freneau write such a stanza as this:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Virtue, Order and Religion</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, and seek some other region;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your plan is fixed to hunt them down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroy the mitre, rend the gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that vile b-tc-h&mdash;Philosophy&mdash;restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did ever paper plan so much before?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">And then explain it by saying that "<i>The National
Gazette</i> is the vehicle of party spleen and opposition to
the great principles of order, virtue and religion."</p>

<p>In view of all this, it is not strange that he should
have been impatient with the conservative party, who
not only did not grow enthusiastic over the French
Revolution, but even looked upon it with actual disapprobation.
From the very first, the editor of the
<i>Gazette</i> criticised the leading Federalists, especially
Adams and Hamilton, and he even mildly rebuked
Washington, the hero of his earlier muse. The administration,
in his mind, was leaning toward monarchial
ideas. Washington, in his opinion, had exceeded his
power in the matter of the banks, and the precedent
was a dangerous one. The ceremonials with which
the President had hedged himself about were greatly
at variance with simple democratic ideas; and, to
crown all, the ingratitude of the administration (to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
extremists it could have no other name) in its attitude
toward Genet and the French people hurt him deeply.
I believe that Freneau was fundamentally honest in
his position. It is almost impossible to believe that
a note like this, in the <i>Jersey Chronicle</i> of 1795, is not
sincere:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The conduct of the Federal Executive of this country toward the
Republic of France, so far as it may appear inimical, has given great
and general disgust to the citizens of the United States.... It would
be well if some that might be mentioned would recollect the nation that
supported us in the late war when our infant Republic was on the point
of annihilation. Enmity to France is treason against Republicanism."</p></div>

<p>In regard to Adams, who had danced at the King's
ball in a scarlet suit, and Hamilton, the father of the
Federalists, Freneau had no scruples. The attacks of
the <i>Gazette</i> became more and more pointed with every
issue, though much of the more incendiary matter was
not from Freneau's pen. The "Probationary Odes," for
instance, attributed to him by contemporary enemies,
and in later years quoted by Buckingham and Duyckinck
as from his pen, were written by St. George
Tucker. They were published in book form by Tucker
in 1796. In the sensitive state of party politics at this
time, such frank criticism could not fail to raise a
tempest of rebuttal and of counter abuse. It was soon
noted that the <i>Gazette</i>, in its attacks upon the administration,
spared the State department. Jefferson was
never mentioned except for praise. The inference was
obvious: either he had "muzzled" the paper by granting
it certain favors, or he was making use of it as
a weapon against the very administration of which he
was a member.</p>

<p>Hamilton naturally inclined toward the latter view,
and much bitterness was the result. On July 25, 1792,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
he inserted this anonymous bit in <i>Fenno's Gazette of the
United States</i>, the Federalist organ:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p>"The Editor of the <i>National Gazette</i> receives a salary from Government:</p>

<p>"Quere&mdash;Whether this salary is paid him for <i>translations</i>; or for
<i>publications</i>, the design for which is to vilify those to whom the voice of
the people has committed the administration of our public affairs&mdash;to
oppose the measures of Government, and, by false insinuations, to disturb
the public peace?</p>

<p>"In common life it is thought ungrateful for a man to bite the
hand that puts bread in his mouth; but if the man is hired to do it, the
case is altered.</p>

<p class="ralign">T. L."</p>
</div>

<p>This was the beginning of a series of anonymous
attacks in the Federalist newspaper, written undoubtedly
by Hamilton. A second article, still more definite,
appeared on August 4th. In it the writer directly
charged Jefferson with being the soul and spirit of the
<i>National Gazette</i>. "Mr. Freneau was thought a fit
instrument," and so was deliberately engaged; he was
simply the "faithful and devoted servant of the head
of a party from whose hands he received a boon." The
article then proceeds at length to arraign Jefferson and
to appeal to the American people, whether they will
consent to see the precious legacies which are theirs
"frittered away" in so shameless a manner.</p>

<p>This attack called forth (from Freneau) an affidavit
which was printed in the <i>Gazette</i>, August 8, 1792:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Personally appeared before me, Matthew Clarkson, Mayor of the
City of Philadelphia, Philip Freneau, of the City of Philadelphia, who,
being duly sworn, doth depose and say, That no negociation was ever
opened with him by Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State, for the establishment
or institution of the <i>National Gazette</i>: that the deponent's
coming to the City of Philadelphia, as publisher of a Newspaper, was
at no time urged, advised, or influenced by the above officer, but that it
was his own voluntary act; and that the said Gazette, nor the Editor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
thereof, was ever directed, controuled, or attempted to be influenced, in
any manner, either by the Secretary of State, or any of his friends; nor
was a line ever, directly or indirectly, written, dictated, or composed for
it by that officer, but that the Editor has consulted his own judgment
alone in the conducting of it&mdash;free&mdash;unfettered&mdash;and uninfluenced.</p>


<p class="ralign">"<span class="smcap">Philip Freneau.</span></p>

<p>"Sworn the 6th August, 1772, before</p>
<p class="ralign">"<span class="smcap">Matthew Clarkson</span>, Mayor."</p>
</div>

<p>Hamilton followed, August 11th, with another article.
He emphatically discredited Freneau's oath, declaring
that "facts spoke louder than words, and under
certain circumstances louder than oaths;" that "the
editor of the <i>National Gazette</i> must not think to swear
away their efficacy;" that "if he was truly, as they
announced, the pensioned tool of the public character
who had been named, no violation of truth in any shape
ought to astonish; equivocations and mental reservations
were the too common refuge of minds struggling
to escape from disgraceful imputations." The article
then proceeded to show that Jefferson did really establish
the <i>Gazette</i> through a particular friend.</p>

<p>Freneau at once declined to answer further the
attacks, on the ground that they were mere "personal
charges," and Hamilton promptly branded this as "a
mere subterfuge." Thus Freneau found himself in the
midst of a perfect hornet's nest of partisan strife that
involved the country from end to end. The Federal
organ continued its attacks, and Freneau, always restive
under criticism, increased in bitterness.</p>

<p>On September 9, 1792, Jefferson put himself on
record in a letter to Washington.<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The letter is extremely
long, since it covers the entire contest with
Hamilton from the beginning. In it he declared:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"While the Government was at New York I was applied to on behalf
of Freneau to know if there was any place within my department to
which he could be appointed. I answered there were but four clerkships,
all of which I found full, and continued without any change.
When we removed to Philadelphia, Mr. Pintard, the translating clerk,
did not choose to remove with us. His office then became vacant. I
was again applied to there for Freneau, and had no hesitation to promise
the clerkship for him. I cannot recollect whether it was at the same
time, or afterwards, that I was told he had a thought of setting up a
newspaper there. But whether then, or afterwards, I considered it a circumstance
of some value, as it might enable me to do, what I had long
wished to have done, that is, to have the material parts of the Leyden
Gazette brought under your eye, and that of the public, in order to possess
yourself and them of a juster view of the affairs of Europe than
could be obtained from any other public source. This I had ineffectually
attempted through the press of Mr. Fenno, while in New York, selecting
and translating passages myself at first, then having it done by Mr.
Pintard, the translating clerk, but they found their way too slowly into
Mr. Fenno's papers. Mr. Bache essayed it for me in Philadelphia, but
his being a daily paper, did not circulate sufficiently in the other States.
He even tried, at my request, the plan of a weekly paper of recapitulation
from his daily paper, in hopes, that that might go into the other States,
but in this too we failed. Freneau, as translating clerk, and the printer
of a periodical paper likely to circulate through the States (uniting in
one person the parts of Pintard and Fenno) revived my hopes that the
thing could at length be effected. On the establishment of his paper,
therefore, I furnished him with the Leyden Gazettes, with an expression
of my wish that he could always translate and publish the material intelligence
they contained, and have continued to furnish them from time to
time, as regularly as I received them. But as to any other direction
or indication of my wish how his press should be conducted, what sort
of intelligence he should give, what essays encourage, I can protest, in the
presence of Heaven that I never did by myself, or any other, or indirectly,
say a syllable, nor attempt any kind of influence. I can further
protest, in the same awful presence, that I never did, by myself, or any
other, directly or indirectly, write, dictate or procure any one sentence or
sentiment to be inserted <i>in his</i>, <i>or any other gazette</i>, to which my name
was not affixed, or that of my office.... Freneau's proposition to publish
a paper, having been about the time that the writings of Publicola, and
the discourses on Davila, had a good deal excited the public attention,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
I took for granted from Freneau's character, which had been marked as
that of a good Whig, that he would give free place to pieces written
against the aristocratical and monarchial principles these papers had
inculcated. This having been in my mind, it is likely enough I may
have expressed it in conversation with others, though I do not recollect
that I did. To Freneau I think I could not, because I had still seen him
but once, and that at a public table, at breakfast, at Mrs. Elsworth's, as
I passed through New York the last year. And I can safely declare
that my expectations looked only to the chastisement of the aristocratical
and monarchial writers, and not to any criticisms on the proceedings of
Government. Colonel Hamilton can see no motive for any appointment,
but that of making a convenient partisan. But you, sir, who have
received from me recommendations of a Rittenhouse, Barlow, Paine,
will believe that talents and science are sufficient motives with me in
appointments to which they are fitted; and that Freneau, as a man of
genius, might find a preference in my eye to be a translating clerk, and
make good title to the little aids I could give him as the editor of a
gazette, by procuring subscriptions to his paper, as I did some before it
appeared, and as I have with pleasure done for the labors of other men
of genius. I hold it to be one of the distinguishing excellences of elective
over hereditary successions, that the talents which nature has provided
in sufficient proportion, should be selected by the society for the government
of their affairs, rather than this should be transmitted through the
loins of knaves and fools, passing from the debauches of the table to
those of the bed. Colonel Hamilton, alias 'Plain Facts,' says, that
Freneau's salary began before he resided in Philadelphia. I do not
know what quibble he may have in reserve on the word 'residence.'
He may mean to include under that idea the removal of his family; for
I believe he removed himself before his family did, to Philadelphia. But
no act of mine gave commencement to his salary before he so far took
up his abode in Philadelphia, as to be sufficiently in readiness for the
duties of the office. As to the merits or demerits of his paper, they
certainly concern me not. He and Fenno are rivals for the public favor.
The one courts them by flattery, the other by censure, and I believe it
will be admitted that the one has been as servile, as the other severe.
But is not the dignity, and even decency of Government committed, when
one of its principal ministers enlists himself as an anonymous writer or
paragraphist for either the one or the other of them? No government
ought to be without censors; and where the press is free, no one ever
will. If virtuous, it need not fear the fair operation of attack and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
defence. Nature has given to man no other means of sifting out the
truth either in religion, law, or politics. I think it as honorable to the
Government neither to know, nor notice, its sycophants or censors, as it
would be undignified and criminal to pamper the former and persecute
the latter."<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>But if the <i>National Gazette</i> concerned Jefferson not
at all, as he alleged, it certainly did exasperate Washington.
Later on, when the Genet affair had urged
Freneau into still greater excesses, Washington, on the
23d of May, 1793, had a conversation with Jefferson,
which the latter recorded in his <i>Ana</i>:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"He [the President] adverted to a piece in Freneau's paper of
yesterday, he said he despised all their attacks on him personally, but
that there never had been an act of the government, not meaning in the
Executive line only, but in any line, which that paper had not abused.
He had also marked the word republic thus&mdash;&mdash;where it was applied
to the French republic [see the original paper]. He was evidently sore
&amp; warm, and I took his intention to be that I should interpose in
some way with Freneau; perhaps withdraw his appointment of translating
clerk to my office. But I will not do it. His paper has saved
our constitution, which was galloping fast into monarchy, &amp; has been
checked by no one means so powerfully as by that paper. It is well
and universally known, that it has been that paper which has checked
the career of the monocrats, &amp; the President, not sensible of the
designs of the party, has not with his usual good sense and <i>sang froid</i>,
looked on the efforts and effects of this free press and seen that, though
some bad things have passed through it to the public, yet the good have
preponderated immensely."<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>Washington even brought the affair into a meeting
of the Cabinet, declaring, according to Jefferson's <i>Ana</i>,
that,</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"That rascal, Freneau, sent him three copies of his paper every
day as if he thought he (Washington) would become the distributor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
them; that he could see in this nothing but an impudent design to insult
him; he ended in a high tone."<a name="FNanchor_14_16" id="FNanchor_14_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_16" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>National Gazette</i> published its last issue, October
23, 1793. The collapse of the Genet bubble&mdash;the
revulsion of feeling after the Frenchman had threatened
to appeal from Washington to the people, brought
on a tidal wave which swept away all the idols of
French Republicanism in America, and the <i>National
Gazette</i> could not withstand the tide. Subscribers
withdrew their subscriptions at a ruinous rate, the
notes of the proprietors were protested, and the paper
was abandoned. Freneau had no idea, however, of
final surrender. His last word was a promise which,
however, was never fulfilled.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"With the present number concludes the second volume and second
year's publication of the <i>National Gazette</i>. Having just imported on
his own account a considerable quantity of new and elegant printing
types from Europe, it is the editor's intention to resume the publication
of this paper in a short time and previous to the meeting of Congress in
December next."</p></div>

<p>It is upon this episode that the reputation of Freneau
among the generality of people chiefly rests.
"That rascal Freneau" is the epithet that has clung to
his name through all the intervening century. It is
this one affair, more than anything else, that has kept
him from the recognition he deserves, both as a patriot
and a poet. The attitude of New England may be
expressed in the words of President Dwight, written
during the summer of 1793:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Freneau, your printer, linguist, &amp;c., is regarded here as a mere
incendiary, or rather as a despicable tool of bigger incendiaries, and his
paper as a public nuisance."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Letters might be multiplied in showing the same
spirit in all of the Federalists.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, however, that Freneau
acted from pure and honest motives; that the excitement
and bitter partisanship of the period were extraordinary,
and that the air was heavily charged with
the subtle magnetism that in France had created a
reign of terror. It cannot be denied that Freneau
went to excess in his denunciations; but so did Hamilton,
who in reality began the conflict; so did Jefferson;
so did many others. As to the extent to which
Jefferson went in subsidizing the <i>Gazette</i> for his own
use, the reader may judge for himself. Neither side is
free from blame; Freneau is certainly no more culpable
than the others who held far higher positions than
he. It is but justice to say of Freneau, in the words
of Jefferson's biographer, Randall&mdash;</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"He was always a warm, and after the period of which we write,
became a violent partisan. It is but justice to his memory, however, to
say that his honor and his veracity as a man were never questioned by
those who knew him, and that his reputation in these particulars is now
as free from all taint of suspicion as is that of any of the distinguished
gentlemen whose names were associated with his in the controversy."</p></div>

<p>The following words of Madison, taken from Mr.
Trist's memoranda of a conversation, May 25, 1827,
and published in Tucker's Life of Jefferson, probably
presents the affair in its true light:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Mr. Madison said: 'Freneau's paper was another cause of soreness
in General Washington. Among its different contributors, some
were actuated by over-heated zeal, and some, perhaps, by malignity.
Every effort was made in Fenno's paper, and by those immediately
around him (Washington) to impress on his mind a belief that this
paper had been got up by Mr. Jefferson to injure him and oppose the
measures of his administration. Freneau himself was an old College
mate of mine, a poet and man of literary and refined tastes, knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
nothing of the world. He was a French scholar, and employed at first
as translator. Henry Lee, who was also his College mate, and had also
a friendly feeling for him, was the more immediate cause of his establishing
a paper. Our main object in encouraging it, was to provide an
antidote against Fenno's paper, which was devoted to monarchy, and
had begun to publish extracts from Mr. Adams's book. I used occasionally
to throw in an article, all of which I have marked, and some of
which I have shown you, with a view chiefly to counteract the monarchial
spirit and partisanship of the British government which characterized
Fenno's paper. I never engaged in the party criminations.'"</p></div>

<p>It deserves mention that Freneau stuck to his post
during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, and that for
weeks he was the only active editor in the city. On
October 1st he resigned his position as translator, and
soon after removed to his old home at Mount Pleasant.
For a time he was without employment. He contemplated
several newspaper enterprises. He evidently
took steps toward the publication of a paper in Monmouth
County, New Jersey, as the following advertisement,
published in the <i>Jersey Chronicle</i>, May 30,
1795, would show:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"A number of persons in Freehold and other parts of Monmouth
subscribed last year to a paper the editor then proposed to set on foot.
As various causes delayed him prosecuting his intended purpose until
the present spring, and as he supposes, many of them might in the
meantime have engaged with other printers, he hopes they will if possible
transfer their subscription to the <i>Chronicle</i>."</p></div>

<p>On November 2, 1794, he writes Madison, recommending
his old friend Bailey for the office of public
printer, and on May 6th following, he received a
reply:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I delayed acknowledging your favour long ago received, until I
could inform you of the prospects of Mr. Bailey in whose favor it was
written. I have now the pleasure to tell you that although his wishes
are not to be immediately fulfilled he is looking to obtain under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
auspices of Mr. Beckley and Mr. Randolph a share of employment hereafter
which may be very valuable to him. I congratulate you on the
public intelligence just received from Holland which gives joy to all
true Republicans, and wish you all the private happiness which an
exchange of your former travelled scenes for the shade and tranquility
of your present life can afford. Remember, however, as you have not
chosen any longer to labor in the field of politics it will be expected by
your friends that you cultivate with the more industry your inheritance
on Parnassus."</p></div>

<p>On May the 20th following, Freneau continued the
correspondence:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"My respected friend: By some accident your kind letter of April
6th was a long time in finding its way hither, having not come to hand
till the 17th inst. I sincerely thank you for the interest you have taken
in Mr. Bailey. He is a good Republican and a worthy honest man,
which qualifications, I have thought, entitled him to some notice from
the Government, in his line of business&mdash;I was heartily laughed at,
however, a few weeks ago in N. York, by some Aristocrats, for having
in my Letter to you or Mr. Beckley, I forget which, extolled his Military
services in the late War&mdash;I am sensible he never cut off the heads of
Giants or drove hosts before him, as some have done; at the same time
it ought to be remembered that he was an officer in the Pennsylvania
Militia in the season that tried men's souls (as Paine says) and I believe
never acted otherwise than became the character in which he acted.&mdash;</p>

<p>I meet you at least half way in your congratulations on the public
intelligence received from Holland. It is but another step toward the
advancement and completion of that great and philanthropic System
which I have been anticipating for many years, and which you as well as
myself, I hope, will live to see realized&mdash;When I first went to reside in
Philada. in 1791 I wished to be one of those who would have the
honour and happiness of announcing these great events to the public
through the medium of a newspaper: A variety of circumstances however,
needless to trouble you with, urged my departure from that city
after completing a two years publication&mdash;As I mean to pass the
remainder of my days on a couple of hundred of acres of an old sandy
patrimony, I have, by the way of filling up the vacuities of time set on foot
a small weekly Newspaper calculated for the part of the country in which
I am. Should you have any curiosity to see it I will forward it to you
free of all expence except that of postage. I will not make high promises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
in regard to what it may contain. It will scarcely be expected that
in a rude barbarous part of the country I could calculate it for the polite
taste of Philadelphia.&mdash;Should your fixed residence be in Philada. I
can transmit the papers to you once a week by the Public Post, who
stops every Wednesday at my door. A Letter put into the Post Office
at Philadelphia on Saturday morning, will be sure to reach me on Wednesday.&mdash;The
public papers some time ago announced your Marriage.&mdash;I
wish you all possible happiness with the lady whom you have chosen for
your Companion through life&mdash;Mrs. Freneau joins me in the same, and
desires me to present her best respects to your lady and yourself&mdash;and
should you ever take an excursion to these parts of Jersey, we will
endeavour to give Mrs. Madison and yourself&mdash;'if not a costly welcome,
yet a kind.'"</p></div>

<p>The <i>Jersey Chronicle</i>, an eight-paged paper of the
size of a sheet of letter paper, issued its initial number
from the editor's little office at Mount Pleasant, Saturday,
May 2, 1795. It bore the motto, "<i>Inter Sylvas
Academi quaerere verum</i>.&mdash;Hor.;" and its object, in the
words of its editor, was "to present ... a complete
history of the foreign and domestic events of the Times,
together with such essays, remarks, and observations
as shall tend to illustrate the politics, or mark the general
character of the age and country in which we
live." The editor's salutatory is characteristic of its
author:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Never was there a more interesting period than the present, nor
ever was there a time within the reach of history when mankind have
been so generally united in attending to the cultivation of the mind,
examining into the natural and political rights of nations, and emancipating
themselves from those shackles of despotism which have so
long impeded the happiness of the human species, and rendered the
rights of the many subservient to the interests of the few.</p>

<p>"At this time, when new Republics are forming and new Empires
bursting into birth; when the great family of mankind are evidently
making their egress from the dark shadows of despotism which have
so long enveloped them, &amp; are assuming a character suitable to the
dignity of their species, the Editor seizes the opportunity to renew his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
efforts for contributing, in some small degree, to the general information
of his fellow citizens in the present history and politics of the world.
No pains shall be spared, on his part, to procure the best, the most
authentic, and earliest intelligence from every quarter, and circulating it
by every method and means in his power; and to whatever parts his
subscription will enable him to do it.</p>

<p>"When it is considered that few Advertisements are reasonably to
be expected in these more eastern parts of New-Jersey, the terms of
subscription will appear low, and, it may be added, are within the
power of almost every man who has the will and inclination to encourage
literature, promote the interests, or enlarge the ideas of the rising
generation, and contribute to the general diffusion of knowledge among
his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>"Should the publication of The Jersey Chronicle be suitably encouraged,
the Editor will in due time enlarge the size of the sheet; but that
now published on is, in his opinion, every way adequate to an experiment
whether the attempt be practicable or not."</p></div>

<p>Freneau's essays contributed to the <i>Chronicle</i> are
among the most notable prose productions from his
pen. He began a series of studies "On Monarchial
and Mixed Forms of Government;" he wrote "Observations
on Monarchy," and discussed at length the
leading arguments for and against Jay's Treaty with
England. On May 23d he began to publish a series of
papers entitled "Tomo Cheeki, the Creek Indian in
Philadelphia," in which the manners and absurdities
of the Americans are described from the standpoint of
an observant savage. In nearly every issue of the
paper there was an elaborate essay on some political
subject. Of poetry there was very little. The <i>National
Gazette</i> had contained little poetry from the editor's
pen, save earlier verses reprinted, and a few political
satires and republican lyrics. The influence of Peter
Pindar was becoming more and more manifest in the
poet's style. Politics and party strife had for a time
displaced the muse. This is nowhere more evident than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
in the collected edition of his poems printed on his own
press and issued in June, 1795.</p>

<p>In many respects this is the most interesting of
Freneau's collections: it brings us into the very presence
of the poet. The earlier editions had been published
without his supervision, the material for this one
passed all of it under the author's critical eye. Scarcely
a poem escaped revision. After noting the scrupulous
care with which he changed adjectives, improved
rhymes, added new stanzas, or cut out old ones, repunctuated
sentences, and rearranged material, one cannot
join the somewhat large band of hasty and superficial
critics who allude flippantly to the poet as a hasty and
careless improviser of ephemeral trash. As a matter
of fact, Freneau was a miser with his verses. When a
newspaper poem suspected to be his, especially in the
period previous to 1795, cannot be found in any of his
collections, grave doubts at once arise as to whether
the poem is his. He was never tired of revising, and
cutting, and pruning. The poems so carefully edited
in 1795 were again carefully revised in 1809. As an
instance of his concern for the fate of his poems let me
quote a letter, written August 29, 1781, to Matthew
Carey:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I see by this day's paper that my verses on General Washington's
arrival, etc., are to appear in your next <i>Museum</i>. If it is not too late, I
would request the favour of you to rectify an error (which was entirely
of the press) in the fifth line of the thirteenth stanza, as it materially
affects the sense. Instead of 'whom' please to read 'who.'"</p></div>

<p>The 1795 edition is interesting from another standpoint.
The resources of the little country office were
taxed to the utmost in the production of the book. At
best it is a crude piece of printing. There is manifest
everywhere an effort to keep the work within bounds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>
to economize space. Titles are abbreviated, mottoes
dropped, foot notes cut out, and many earlier poems
reduced, or omitted entirely. The list of omissions is
very suggestive: scenes one and two were cut from the
"Pictures of Columbus," the long song of Ismenius was
dropped from "The Monument of Phaon," "The
Jamaica Funeral," and "The House of Night" were
reduced to mere fragments, "Female Frailty" was
dropped save for the opening lyric, and there were
other notable changes. In every case it will be found
that the poet threw overboard the light and imaginative
element, the purely poetic.</p>

<p>The reason for these omissions has been often
sought. Prof. C. F. Richardson in particular has wondered
at the dropping of the intensely original and
weirdly strong poem "The House of Night,"&mdash;in his
opinion the best thing Freneau ever did. It is not difficult
to answer the question after a careful study of the
evolution of Freneau's poetic ideals. He began to write
poetry after a thorough course of reading in the Latin
and English classics. His early work is redolent of
Virgil's "Eclogues," of Horace, of Shakespeare, of
Milton's minor poems, of Gray's "Elegy." If ever
there was a sensitive, beauty-loving, poetic soul, the
young Freneau was one. In his early inexperience he
even dreamed of a poetic career in which he might perhaps
win a place beside the great masters of song. His
early work like the "Ode to Fancy," and similar pieces,
and the strong and original "House of Night" and
"Santa Cruz" show what he might have done in another
environment.</p>

<p>But Revolutionary America had little encouragement
for an imaginative poet. There was something
in the air that seemed to put into men the Franklin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
spirit. It was the era of common-sense, of stern reality,
of practical affairs. Madison voiced the age when in
1774 he advised Bradford, the cultured and imaginative
young lover of poetry and all art, to turn to sterner
things:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I was afraid you would not easily have loosened your affections
from the Belles Lettres. A Delicate Taste and warm imagination like
yours must find it hard to give up such refined &amp; exquisite enjoyments
for the coarse and dry study of the Law. It is like leaving a
pleasant flourishing field for a barren desert; perhaps I should not say
barren either because the Law does bear fruit but it is sour fruit that
must be gathered and pressed and distilled before it can bring pleasure
or profit.... I myself use to have too great a hankering after those
amusing studies. Poetry wit and Criticism Romances Plays &amp;c. captivated
me much: but I begin to discover that they deserve but a moderate
portion of a <i>mortal's</i> Time and that something more substantial
more durable more profitable befits our riper age. It would be exceeding
improper for a labouring man to have nothing but flowers in his
Garden or to determine to eat nothing but sweet-meats and confections.
Equally absurd would it be for a Scholar and man of Business to make
up his whole Library with Books of Fancy and feed his mind with
nothing but such Luscious performances."<a name="FNanchor_15_17" id="FNanchor_15_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_17" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>The first half of Freneau's life, as we have seen,
was one of disillusion. It took twenty-five years to
kill the spark in his breast, but the process though slow
was sure. After the fierce period of the <i>National Gazette</i>
he thought of himself only as a worker in the tide of
practical affairs, a champion of the rights of man, a
protestor against tyranny and wrong, and his muse had
become a mere drudge, aiding by satire and song what
he now conceived to be his life work. He had taken a
deliberate though sorrowful leave of his early muse in
1787, one year after the appearance of his first volume
of poems:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot read long the columns of the <i>Jersey
Chronicle</i> without realizing forcibly the change that had
come over Freneau. The poet who emerged from the
crucible of the <i>National Gazette</i> was not at all like the
poet of "The House of Night" period. He could look
upon this product of his early imagination much as
Madison would have done, and he could in cold blood
cut it down to a mere fragment which would voice his
new French Deistic ideas, that he might have room for
his Republican songs. The poem "To the Americans
of the United States," written in 1797, gives us a true
picture of this later Freneau. He would be no courtly
singer "beneath some great man's ceiling placed," no
solitary dreamer. He would be a man of action travelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
over lands and seas, a poet who caught his subjects
from the varying scene of human things.</p>

</div>

<p>With the fifty-second number of the <i>Chronicle</i>, published
April 30, 1796, the paper came to an end. Freneau's
final editorial stated that:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"In number one of the Jersey Chronicle the editor announced his
intention of extending the publication beyond the first year, provided the
attempt should in the meantime be suitably encouraged and found practicable.
But the necessary number of subscribers having not yet appeared,
scarcely to defray the expenses of the undertaking, notwithstanding the
very low rate at which it has been offered, the editor with some regret
declines a further prosecution of his plan at this time. He embraces
the present opportunity to return his sincere thanks to such persons in
this and the neighboring counties as have favored him with their subscriptions;
and have also by their punctuality in complying with the
terms originally proposed, thus far enabled him to issue a free, independent,
and republican paper."</p></div>

<p>A letter<a name="FNanchor_16_18" id="FNanchor_16_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_18" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> written by Freneau from New York, to
Madison, dated December 1, 1796, reveals what was in
the poet's mind during the months following the abandonment
of the <i>Chronicle</i>:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Having three or four months since formed a resolution to bid
adieu for a few years to some old Trees in Jersey under the shade of
which I edited, amongst ditching and grubbing, a small weekly Paper
entitled the Jersey Chronicle, I did not know how to employ that interval
better than in striking out here with some printer, if such could be found,
already engaged in supporting the good old Republican cause. After
experiencing one or two disappointments in accomplishing this object, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>
am now through the kind aid of some friends here nearly completing the
project of a copartnership with Thomas Greenleaf in his two Papers,
<i>The Argus</i>, a daily publication, and the New York Journal, twice a
week; both on a pretty respectable footing, and noted for a steady
attachment to Republican principles, though open to all decent speculations
from any party if they choose to transmit them. In short, I would
wish to revive something in the spirit of the National Gazette, if time
and circumstances allow, and with proper assistance hope to succeed&mdash;Thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Raven once an acorn took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Bashan's strongest stoutest tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hid it near a murmuring brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And liv'd another oak to see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">As I consider the bargain the same as concluded, my next object is to
make all the friends here that I decently can among men of eminence
and ability. This I have in some small degree attempted and gained,
but for want of certain insinuating qualities, natural enough I suppose
to some men, I feel myself sadly at a loss to get acquainted with some
characters here to whom I could wish to be known upon motives of public
as well as private utility.</p>

<p>"Among these is the chancellor of this State, Robert R. Livingston,
with whom, if I recollect right, you are upon terms of intimacy. If I
am not mistaken in this point, and you can with propriety accede to my
request, you would confer a favor upon me by mentioning me to him in
your next Letter, in such manner as you may think best, so that this new
connexion may attract some share of his attention, and thereby the
countenance of the Livingston family in general, which would operate
greatly, through this State at least, in advancing our Subscription and
printing Interest in general."</p></div>

<p>The partnership with Greenleaf, mentioned to Madison,
for some reason was never consummated. On
March 13, 1797, however, Freneau issued in New York
the first number of a new journal, <i>The Time Piece and
Literary Companion</i>, to be devoted to "literary amusement
and an abridgement of the most interesting intelligence
foreign and domestic." He "associated himself,"
as he expressed it, "as a partner in the typographical
line of business with Mr. Alexander Menut of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
profession, sometime since from Canada," though, during
the first year at least, Freneau had entire control of
the editing of the paper. His address to the public is
of considerable interest:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Several months having elapsed since the publication of a periodical
paper in this city was first contemplated by the subscriber, he now
informs his friends and the public in general that he has at length so far
matured his plan as to attempt a paper of this kind to be published
three times a week and transmitted to city subscribers early on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday mornings.</p>

<p>"The <i>Time Piece and Literary Companion</i> will on all occasions be
open to political, moral, or other interesting discussion from any quarter
whatever provided such communications are written with candor, decency,
and liberality, their object such as to promote the general good of our
great Confederate Commonwealth, or the common interest of man, and
conceived in that disinterested spirit which while it carefully avoids as
far as possible irritating the feelings of individuals, holds itself obligated
under any circumstances whatever to consider truth, the moral and political
happiness of our species, social harmony, and good order, the basis
of all its exertions, the end of all its aims, views and endeavors."</p></div>

<p>The paper is a tastily arranged and neatly printed
sheet, and its contents show constantly its editor's
rare ability to cater to the public needs. Refinement
and a fastidious taste are evidenced everywhere in its
columns. Duyckinck comments on "the skill of the
selection and the general elegance of the material,"
which were certainly unusual in those early days of
American journalism. The paper had a large number
of feminine contributors, who gave freely of their sentimental
lyrics and sprightly letters. The poet himself
contributed many poems, the most of them, as usual,
concerned with contemporary affairs. He republished
his translation from the Abb&eacute; Robin made in 1783
since, as he declared, only a small edition was then
printed, and the work was in the hands of a very few.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span>
He republished also his "Tomo Cheeki" letters, introducing
them thus:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"A number of eccentric writings under the subsequent title and to
the amount of a considerable volume are in the hands of the editor of
the Time Piece said to be translated from one of the Indian languages
of this country. They were transmitted to him more than two years
ago and a few numbers published in a gazette edited by him in a neighboring
State, but discontinued with that paper. If the contributions of
a rude aboriginal of America shall appear to afford any gratification to
the generality of our readers the whole will be occasionally offered to
the public through the medium of the Time Piece."</p></div>

<p>His pen was constantly active. He wrote vigorous
editorials on all passing political measures, and on September
1, 1897, proposed to edit Ledyard's Journals:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The subscriber having procured from the hands of his relatives
the original MSS. of Mr. Ledyard now offers to the public of the United
States an opportunity of gratifying their curiosity and at the same time
paying a token of respect to the memory of Ledyard. Ledyard's travels
will be compiled by P. Freneau from the original MSS. of the author,
consisting of letters, journals, notes, etc., etc., and such documents as
have appeared in print, both in America and Europe, particularly a work
published by the British African Society, in whose service, with a view
of exploring the interior of Africa, his last expedition was undertaken
and terminated in his death at Cairo, in Egypt.</p>

<p>"One vol. at least 250 pages.</p>

<p>"A life of the author collected from authentic materials will be
prefixed to the work, with some other preliminary matter."</p></div>

<p>Freneau evidently made some progress with the
work, for on August 30, 1798, the following advertisement
appeared in the <i>Time Piece</i>, as well as in the
Charleston <i>City Gazette</i>:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The interesting travels of John Ledyard, with a summary of his
life, are now in the hands of the printer.</p>

<p>"It shall be printed on fine paper with new type ornamented with
a full length portrait of the author in the attitude of taking leave on his
departure for Africa. Page octavo, handsomely bound and lettered.
Calculated to contain between 400 and 500 pages. $2 per volume."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The volume, whether from a failure to secure subscribers
or other reasons, was never published.</p>

<p>The partnership of Freneau and Menut was dissolved
September 13, 1797, and shortly after, the imprint
of the paper was changed to read "Published by P.
Freneau and M. L. Davis, No. 26 Moore Street, near
Whitehall." On January 3, 1798, Freneau made a visit
to Charleston, taking passage in the sloop <i>Katy</i>, and
arriving after a rough voyage of thirty-one days. During
the following month he was the guest of his brother,
Peter, and in the words of his daughter, of "his many
friends there, among whom were Charles Pinckney,
Governor of South Carolina, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
General Bull, Edge, and many others where he was
as much at home as at his brother's." He embarked
from Charleston March 7th and arrived in New York
after a week's voyage.</p>

<p>The affairs of the <i>Time Piece</i> were in a critical condition.
A part of the subscribers lived at a distance
from New York and the expenses were large. Freneau
was unwilling to run further risks, and a few days after
his return from the South, he withdrew from the firm,
having been editor of the paper just one year. He
thereupon retired with his family to the little estate at
Mount Pleasant, where he made his home for the rest
of his life.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The quiet period after the anxiety and stress of
editorship in a great city was for a time grateful to the
poet. He managed the farm in a desultory way, but
his main occupation was composing verses under his
favorite locust tree which had been planted by his father
and which had increased in size and numbers until in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>
words of his daughter, "it was a complete grove of
locust trees surrounding a house grown old with its
time worn owner, his venerable mother and maiden
sister beloved and respected for her many virtues. Her
decease, which took place a few years previous to
his own, he says in an obituary, he can say no more
nor less than that 'she was as good and innocent as
an angel.'" This sister, Mary Freneau, a beautiful
woman, had been wooed at one time by Madison, but
for some reason she had refused him.</p>

<p>Freneau's family consisted of four daughters:
Eleanor, born in 1791; Agnes W., born June 22, 1794;
Catherine L., born February 25, 1798; and Margaret
Alaire, born June 10, 1801. Eleanor married a Mr.
Hammill, and the four daughters of this union died
unmarried; Agnes married Dr. Edward Leadbeater,
and the eldest son of this union, at the earnest request
of the poet, was christened Philip Leadbeater Freneau,
his grandfather putting into his infant hands the
ancestral Bible, which was the family treasure. The
descendants of Agnes Freneau and Dr. Leadbeater are
very numerous. The two younger daughters of the
poet never married.</p>

<p>The active pen of Freneau, so long practiced in discussing
the affairs of the day, could not rest idle during
his period of retirement. He began a series of letters
to the Philadelphia <i>Aurora</i> and other papers, and on
December 30, 1799, issued them in a volume entitled
"Letters on Various Interesting and Important Subjects,
many of which have appeared in the Aurora." It
bore his old pen name, Robert Slender, with the added
title, O. S. M., interpreted later to mean "One of the
Swinish Multitude." The book has surprising merit.
The letters are written in a breezy, colloquial style, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span>
the simple-minded old cobbler is well characterized.
Freneau has actually succeeded in making him a living
creature, and his opinions and "whim whams" are full
of hard sense and practical wisdom. The book is by
all means the best prose that Freneau ever wrote. So
easy is the style and so natural is the characterization
that I cannot forbear quoting at some length from a
chapter chosen almost at random:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">


<p class="center">LETTER XXII</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>,</p>

<p>Having heard that there was a tavern at about the distance of
a mile or so from my favourite country spot, where now and then
a few neighbours meet to spit, smoke segars, drink apple whiskey,
cider or cider-royal, and read the news&mdash;a few evenings ago, I put on
my best coat, combed out my wig, put my spectacles in my pocket, and
a quarter dollar&mdash;This I thought was right; for although Mrs. Slender
told me eleven-pence was enough, says I, I'll e'en take the quarter dollar,
for a man always feels himself of more consequence when he has
got good money in his pocket&mdash;so out I walks with a good stout stick
in my hand, which I always make a point to carry with me, lest the dogs
should make rather freer with my legs than I could wish. But I had not
gone more than half the way, when, by making a false step, I splash'd
my stocking from knee to the ancle. Odds my heart, said I, see
what a hand I have made of my stocking; I'll be bail, added I, I'll
hear of this in both sides of my head&mdash;but it can't now be helped&mdash;this,
and a thousand worse accidents, which daily happen, are all occasioned
by public neglect, and the misapplication of the public's money&mdash;Had I,
said I, (talking to myself all the while) the disposal of but half the
income of the United States, I could at least so order matters, that a
man might walk to his next neighbour's without splashing his stockings
or being in danger of breaking his legs in ruts, holes, gutts, and gullies.
I do not know, says I to myself, as I moralized on my splash'd stocking,
but money might with more profit be laid out in repairing the roads,
than in marine establishments, supporting a standing army, useless
embassies, exorbitant salaries, given to many flashy fellows that are no
honour to us, or to themselves, and chartering whole ships to carry a
single man to another nation&mdash;Odds my life, continued I, what a number
of difficulties a man labours under, who has never read further than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>
Lilly's grammar, and has but a poor brain&mdash;had I been favoured with a
good education, I could no doubt readily see the <i>great usefulness</i> of all
these measures of government, that now appear to me so unaccountable&mdash;I
could then, said I, still talking to myself, see the reason why the old
patriots, whose blood flowed so freely in purchasing our independence,
are cast aside, like a broken pitcher, (as the scripture says) and why the
old tories and active refugees are advanced to places of power, honour
and trust&mdash;I could then be able to explain why Robbins, an American
citizen, for killing an Englishman who held him a slave, and so gaining
his liberty, was delivered to the English to be hanged&mdash;and Sterret, who
killed a veteran sailor, who had formerly fought and bled in the cause
of his country, and then was bravely doing his duty, yet, remains unpunished....
As I said this, by accident I looked up, and perceived to
my surprise, that if I had gone but one step further, I would have
actually knocked my nose against the sign-post&mdash;I declare, said I, here
I am, this is a tavern indeed. I then felt in my pocket, if I had my
quarter dollar, which to my joy I found&mdash;I then unbuttoned my coat,
to shew my silk waistcoat, pulled my watch chain a good piece longer
out of my pocket, fixed my hat a little better on my head&mdash;and then
advanced boldly into the tavern&mdash;But I see I am got to the end of my
page, and therefore must defer the remainder of my adventure to
another opportunity."</p></div>

<p>In the advertisement of the book, the author made
the half promise of more letters in the same vein:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Should these letters meet with a favourable reception in their present
form, a second volume will shortly be published, containing besides
those that have since appeared separately a variety of original ones
upon such interesting subjects as may hereafter claim the public attention."</p></div>

<p>The volume was never published. The little family
at Mount Pleasant could not subsist alone on letters
and poems, however brilliant. The outlook was not
a bright one, as the following letter<a name="FNanchor_17_19" id="FNanchor_17_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_19" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to his brother
Peter, in Charleston, dated March 1, 1801, would indicate:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span></p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p>"Having been here [New York] a day or two and finding the brig
Echo, Capt. Webb, to sail for Charleston, I take the opportunity of
dropping you a line by him.</p>

<p>"I left all well at home last Thursday, and the place, etc., as well
as could be expected after my poor mother's absence. I have been and
shall be for some time busy in repairing old fences and making new ones,
and some other small improvements, as far as I personally can with the
money you let me have. Helen goes to school here, the other two girls
are at home, but Agnes is to come here next month for the same purpose
for awhile. There are more cares and vexations coming on, but still
they must be got through with at some rate. Probably I shall have to
embark on some new expedition or plan before long wherever or to whatever
the devil, etc., shall see fit to drive me. But I shall attempt nothing
if I can before I see you here, in April or May, as you promised.</p>

<p>"I return this morning to Jersey. Mr. Hunn, Peggy, Mamma and
Polly all desire their love to you. My love and respects to Mrs. Freneau
and Miss Dora with her mother and family. Remembrances, love, etc.,
to Mr. Davis, and may I expect to have a line from you by Capt. Peter."</p></div>

<p>Freneau was at best a half-hearted farmer. A little
anecdote told by the family is eloquent. One day the
poet and his wife, who had walked together into the
field to inspect the work, found a slave asleep in the
young corn. Mrs. Freneau seizing his hoe declared
that she would show him how to work. At the very
first attempt, however, she cut down a hill of corn,
whereupon the slave remarked gleefully: "Ho, ho,
Missie Freneau, if that's the way you hoe, the corn'll
never grow." She threw down the hoe in disgust,
declaring that "No wonder the farm doesn't pay when
even the slaves talk in rhymes."</p>

<p>The affairs of the poet were soon such as to give
real concern to his friends. In a letter dated September
13, 1801, a part of which we have already quoted,
Aedanus Burke wrote Madison:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I am sorry to have it to say that Freneau, with his wife and two
children, is still in embarrassed circumstances. He is a virtuous, honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span>
man, and an undeviating Republican; yet utterly incapable of soliciting
anything for himself. The best apology I can offer for mentioning it,
is that I know you have great regard for him. You were at College
together, as I heard you often say."</p></div>

<p>However this letter may have been received, Freneau
obtained no appointment either from Madison or
Jefferson, though there is a persistent tradition among
his descendants that he was offered a good position
under President Jefferson but refused it on the ground
that the latter had deserted him in the <i>National Gazette</i>
affair. On October 23, 1803, his old-time friend, Francis
Bailey, addressed Madison:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"My dear sir: The death of Col. Bauman of New York has left
the Post Office without a Master. I know of no man in the United
States who would fill the office with more ability, or greater integrity,
than Philip Freneau."</p></div>

<p>As far as we know, there was no response, though
the family declare that Madison sent for him and that
the poet proudly said, "James Madison knows where
I live, let him come to see me."</p>

<p>The "expedition" to mend his fortunes, which he
had mentioned to his brother as a disagreeable possibility,
became at length inevitable. On Saturday, November
27th, he embarked at New York as Master of the
schooner <i>John</i>, bound for Fredericksburg, Virginia, with
a cargo of salt. A minute log book of this voyage is
still to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_18_20" id="FNanchor_18_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_20" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> After an exceedingly hard experience
he returned to New York, January 12, 1803, and the
last entry in the log reads "Finished discharging the
wheat&mdash;1264 bushels at 17 cents a bushel freight&mdash;214
dollars and 88 cents."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the opening voyage of his last period at
sea. His brother Peter had fitted out at Charleston a
new brig for the Madeira trade, and until 1807 Freneau
was busy plying between Charleston and the Azores.
In one of his books of navigation is inscribed the following:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Sailed from Charleston for Maderia with brig Washington, May
12, 1803. Got there June 23. Arrived back at Charleston Aug. 16.</p>

<p>"Sailed in ditto from Charleston Jan. 25, 1804. Arrived in Maderia
March 7th following. A hurricane of wind the whole way. April 12,
sailed from Funchal Road for Teneriff. Arrived at Santa Cruz the
15th; at Arasava, 22nd. Sailed May 11th. Arrived in Charleston,
June 10."</p></div>

<p>On June 30, 1806, he was in Savannah, Georgia,
as Master of the sloop <i>Industry</i>. He made his last voyage
to the Azores in the <i>Washington</i> in 1807. During
this last period of sea life we find evidences everywhere
that this old enthusiasm for nautical adventure had
greatly waned. He was a sailor now from sheer necessity;
he was approaching old age and he longed for the
quiet of his home and his family. In one of his books
of navigation of this period is penned a verse made in
mid Atlantic:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In dreams condemned to roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his native home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er land and ocean vast and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With oar and sail, with wind and tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Proceeding an imaginary way."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In 1809, Freneau now in retirement at Mount Pleasant,
began a new edition of his poems. On April 8, he
wrote Madison:<a name="FNanchor_19_21" id="FNanchor_19_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I do myself the pleasure to enclose to you a copy of Proposals
for the publication of a couple of Volumes of Poems shortly to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span>
put to the Press in this city. Perhaps some of your particular friends in
Virginia may be induced from a view of the Proposals in your hands to
subscribe their names. If so, please to have them forwarded to this place
by Post, addressed to the Publisher at No. 10 North Alley, Philadelphia.
"Accept my congratulations on your late Election to the Presidency of
the United States, and my hopes that your weight of State Affairs
may receive every alleviation in the gratitude and esteem of the Public
whom you serve in your truly honourable and exalted Station."</p></div>

<p>Madison's reply has been lost, but on May 12th,
Freneau answered from Philadelphia:<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;After a month's ramble through the States of New Jersey
and New York, I returned to this place on Saturday last, and found
your friendly Letter on Mr. Bailey's table, with the contents. There was
no occasion of enclosing any Money, as your name was all I wanted to
have placed at the head of the Subscription list.&mdash;I hope you will credit
me when I say that the republication of these Poems, such as they are,
was not a business of my own seeking or forwarding. I found last Winter
an Edition would soon be going on at all events, and in contradiction
to my wishes, as I had left these old scribblings, to float quietly down
the stream of oblivion to their destined element the ocean of forgetfulness.
However, I have concluded to remain here this Summer, and have
them published in a respectable manner, and free as possible from the
blemishes imputable to the two former Editions, over which I had no
controul, having given my manuscripts away, and left them to the mercy
of chance.&mdash;I am endeavouring to make the whole work as worthy of the
public eye as circumstances will allow. 1500 copies are to be printed,
only; but I have a certainty, from the present popular frenzy, that three
times that number might soon be disposed of.&mdash;I will attend to what
you direct on the subject, and will forward the ten you mention by the
middle of July or sooner.&mdash;I will consider of what you say relative to
the insertion of a piece or two in prose, but suspect that anything I
have written in that way is so inferior to the Poetry, that the contrast
will be injurious to the credit of the Publication.&mdash;I feel much in the
humour of remaining here about two years, to amuse myself, as well as
the Public, with such matter as that of the fat man you refer to, and if the
public are in the same humour they shall be gratified.&mdash;But I am intruding
on your time and will add no more at present.&mdash;I had almost said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus<br /></span>

<p>"My best wishes, Sir, will ever await you, and in particular that
your Presidential Career may be equally honourable though less stormy
than that of your predecessor."</p></div>

<p>It is evident that Freneau wrote also to Jefferson,
for on May 22, 1809, the latter wrote from Monticello.<a name="FNanchor_22_24" id="FNanchor_22_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_24" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I subscribe with pleasure to the publication of your
volumes of poems. I anticipate the same pleasure from them which the
perusal of those heretofore published has given me. I have not been
able to circulate the paper because I have not been from home above
once or twice since my return, and because in a country situation like
mine, little can be done in that way. The inhabitants of the country
are mostly industrious farmers employed in active life and reading little.
They rarely buy a book of whose merit they can judge by having it in
their hand, and are less disposed to engage for those yet unknown to
them. I am becoming like them myself in a preference of the healthy
and cheerful employment without doors, to the being immured within
four brick walls. But under the shade of a tree one of your volumes
will be a pleasant pocket companion.</p>

<p>"Wishing you all possible success and happiness, I salute you with
constant esteem and respect."</p></div>

<p>The reply to Freneau's second letter to Jefferson
has also been lost, but Freneau's letter dated Philadelphia,
May 27th, has escaped destruction:<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Yesterday your Letter, dated May 22d came to hand.&mdash;Perhaps
you a little misunderstood me, when I wrote to you from this place
in April last, inclosing the Proposal Paper, respecting the Poems.&mdash;I only
wished your name to be placed at the head of the list, and did not wish
you to be at the pains of collecting Subscriptions, further than as any of
your neighbours might choose to put down their names&mdash;Indeed, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span>
whole Subscription plan was Set a going without my knowledge or
approbation, last Winter. But as I found the matter had gone too far
to be recalled, I thought it best to submit, in the present Edition, to
the course and order of things as they are and must be.&mdash;Sir, if there
be anything like happiness in this our State of existence, it will be such
to me, when these two little Volumes reach you in August ensuing, if
the sentiments in them under the poetical Veil, amuse you but for a
single hour.&mdash;This is the first Edition that I have in reality attended to,
the other two having been published, in a strange way, while I was
wandering over gloomy Seas, until <i>embargoed</i> by the necessity of the
times, and now again, I fear, I am reverting to the folly of scribbling
Verses.</p>

<p>"That your shades of Monticello may afford you complete happiness
is the wish and hope of all the worthy part of Mankind, and my
own in particular. In such the philosophers of antiquity preferred to
pass life, or if that was not allowed, their declining days.</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to read the inclosed Verses? They were
published early in March last in the Trenton True American Newspaper,
and in the Public Advertiser, of New York."</p></div>

<p>On August 7, 1809, Freneau wrote finally to Madison:<a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The two Volumes of Poems that in April last I engaged to
have published, are finished, and will be ready for delivery in two or
three days. The ten Setts you subscribed for I am rather at a loss how
to have safely transmitted to you at your residence in Virginia, where I
find by the Newspapers, you mean to Continue until the end of September.
Will you on receipt of this, send me a line or two, informing me
whether you would prefer having the Books put into the hands of some
Confidential person here, to be sent or; that they be sent to the Post
Office at Washington; or that they be forwarded directly to yourself in
Orange County. The precise direction is not in my power."</p></div>

<p>The 1809 collection is the most elaborate of all
the earlier editions of Freneau's works. His statement
that it was the only one which received his personal
supervision is certainly wrong, for he had carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span>
supervised the 1795 edition. On the title page he
announced that the poems were "now republished from
the original manuscripts," and that he had added several
"translations from the ancients and other pieces not
heretofore in print," but the new poems that had not
previously appeared in the <i>Time Piece</i> were very few.
On the title page also he placed the stanza:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Justly to record the deeds of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A muse from heaven should touch the soul with flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some powerful spirit in superior lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should tell the conflicts of the stormy days."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poet's advertisement is as follows:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The Poems, included in these two volumes, were originally written
between the years 1768 and 1793; and were partly published in the transient
prints of the times, and afterwards collected into two editions of
1786 and 1795. The present is a revision of the whole, and now published
agreeable to the terms of the subscription issued in this city, in
April last. Such, perhaps, as are not attracted by mere novelty or amusement,
will attend more particularly to the Poems originating from the
temporary events of the American war. These Poems were intended,
in part to expose to vice and treason, their own hideous deformity; to
depict virtue, honour and patriotism in their native beauty. Such (says
a most distinguished foreign author) was the intention of poetry from
the beginning, and here her purpose should end. Whether the following
verses have any real claim to the attention of the citizens of the American
United States, who may honour them with a reading, is left for the
Public to decide.</p>

<p>"To his Countrymen, the real <i>Patriotic Americans</i>, the <i>Revolutionary
Republicans</i>, and the rising generation who are attached to their sentiments
and principles, the writer hopes this collection will not prove
unacceptable. A more complete edition might have been published, so
as to include a great number of miscellaneous Poems and animadversions
on public events down to the present year, 1809; but it has been judged
most proper, to restrict what is now printed to the date of 1793; with
the exception of only a very few pieces of later composition which have
been retained, and inserted in the body of the work, but not so as to
materially interrupt the general tenor of the Poems that arose from the
incidents of the American revolutionary contest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Author will only add, that to this Edition are prefixed two
copper-plate engravings: the one representing <span class="smcap">St. Tammany</span>, observing
a hostile fleet approaching his shores; the other a nocturnal view of
Captain Jones's engagement with the Seraphis.&mdash;These, it is hoped will
be considered not inelegant embellishments of the edition now presented
to the public.</p>

<p>"<i>Philadelphia, August 2d, 1809.</i>"</p></div>

<p>The work is divided into four parts:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Book I. Containing translations from the ancients; and other
pieces on various subjects, written in America.</p>

<p>"Book II. Containing original pieces, with some relative to the
more early events of the American Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>"Book III. Containing original poems, written and published at
different periods, during the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>"Book IV. Consisting of Miscellaneous pieces, on the events of
the times, interspersed with others on moral, satirical, and political
subjects."</p></div>

<p>The author made almost no attempt to arrange the
material chronologically as to the dates of composition.
He resurrected none of the material dropped from
the 1795 collection, but cut from the edition some
fifty-five other poems, among them nearly all of the
material relating to the French Revolution, the greater
number of the New Year Odes, and such fine pieces
as "Neversink," "The Country Printer," "Slender's
Journey," and "The Wintry Prospect."</p>

<p>The text was taken largely from the 1795 version,
and a few minor amendments and changes made, but
in no case were they so frequent or so careful as those
made for the second edition. The poet's editorial work
consisted mainly in elaborated titles with Latin quotations,
in foot-notes, and in division of the material into
books.</p>

<p>The next few years of Freneau's life were spent
quietly at Mount Pleasant. He passed his time, as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</a></span>
daughter describes, "in writing poetry, and in answering
and receiving letters." Her picture of the man at
this period is full of interest. "Although no farmer,
he loved to see the work going on. He was very fond
of feeding poultry and all the dumb animals, and when
the season came for slaughtering the porkers, he generally
managed it so as to have some business in New
York, and he was usually absent when poultry was
wanted for dinner. Mrs. Freneau had to give orders
to the blacks to do it privately. He confessed it a
weakness and tried to conceal it."</p>

<p>His interest in politics was still keen. He watched
carefully all the premonitory signs of the approaching
storm of 1812, and when war was found to be inevitable,
his harp was in full tune to satirize the foe,
which he had never ceased to hate, and to celebrate
the heroes and the victories of his country.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1815, we find him again in correspondence
with his old friend Madison:<a name="FNanchor_25_27" id="FNanchor_25_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_27" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Since my last return from the Canary Islands in 1807 to
Charleston and from thence to New York; with my Brigantine Washington,
quitting the bustle and distraction of active life, my walks have
been confined, with now and then a short excursion, to the neighbourhood
of the Never Sink hills, and under some old hereditary trees, and
on some fields, which I well recollect for sixty years. During the last
Seven Years my pen could not be entirely idle, and for amusement only
now and then I had recourse to my old habit of scribbling verses. A
Bookseller in New York, Mr. Longworth, by some means discovered this,
and has prevailed on me to put my papers into his hands for publication.
With some reluctance I consented to gratify his wish, altho' I think after
the age of fifty, or thereabouts, the vanity of authorship ought to cease,
at least it has been the case with myself. Mr. Longworth informs me
the work will be published early in February in two duodecimo volumes.
I have directed him, when done, to forward a copy to yourself, of which
I beg your acceptance. I do not know that the Verses are of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</a></span>
superior or very unusual merit; but he tells me the Town will have them: and
of course, have them they will, and must, it seems. The Work cannot be
very tedious, for in two small Volumes there will be upwards of one hundred
and thirty Poems on different subjects, moral, political, or merely
amusing, and not a few upon the events of the times since May 1812.
However, you know a short production may sometimes be tedious, and a
long one very lively and captivating. None of my effusions in these
Volumes much exceed two hundred lines, and several do not reach more
than the fourth part of that number of lines.</p>

<p>"When I left Philadelphia, about the middle of September 1809,
the ten copies of the Revolutionary Poems, which you subscribed for,
were put into a box well secured, and forwarded according to your direction,
under the care of General Steele, then Collector of the Port of
Philadelphia: I have not since heard whether they reached you or not.</p>

<p>"That Edition was published by <i>Subscription</i> merely for the benefit
of, and to assist Mrs. Bailey, an unfortunate but deserving widowed
female, niece to General Steele, and this consideration alone induced me
to pay some attention to that third Edition.</p>

<p>"But, in mentioning these matters I fear I am intruding both on
your time and patience, constantly, or always perpetually engaged, as
you undoubtedly are, in the duties of your station at a stormy period, a
tempestuous Presidency indeed: May you weather all the conflicts of
these mighty times, and return safe at the proper period to your Virginian
Groves, fields and streams: sure I am, different very different indeed
from your long intercourse with political Life and the affairs of a 'grumbling
Hive.' My best wishes attend Yourself, and Mrs. Madison, to
whom, tho' I never had the pleasure of her acquaintance, I beg you to
present my best compliments and regards."</p></div>

<p>On March 3d following, he writes again to Madison:<a name="FNanchor_26_28" id="FNanchor_26_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_28" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When I mentioned in my few lines to you, dated from my
residence in New Jersey on the 22d of January last, the two Volumes of
Poems publishing in this city by Mr. Longworth, I did really think to
have had a small box of them at Washington by the middle of February
at farthest, with a particular direction of a couple of copies to Yourself
bound in an elegant manner. Finding, however, that the business went
on slowly here, and a little vexed to be under the necessity of leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span>
my Solitude and the wild Scenes of nature in New Jersey for the ever
execrated streets and company of this Capital, I embarked near Sandy
Hook in a snow storm, about the last of January, and shortly after
arrived here, fortunately unnoticed and almost unknown&mdash;At my time of
life, 63!!! abounding however in all the powers of health and vigour,
though I consider my poetry and poems as mere trifles, I was seriously
out of humour on my arrival here to see my work delayed, as well from
the severity of the cold, which has been unremitting for more than a
month past, and perhaps to some other causes it would not be prudent
<i>here</i> to explain. By my incessant exertions in spurring on the indolence
of typography, the work, such as it is, is now finished, in two small Volumes
of about 180 pages each.&mdash;The moment they are out of the bookbinder's
hands, Mr. Longworth will forward you a Copy, and by the first
Vessel to Alexandria, Georgetown, or Washington a Box of them to his
correspondents in these places. A Copy or two of the Revolutionary
poems will be forwarded to your direction&mdash;I am sorry the Copies you
had were doomed to the flames, but the author had nearly suffered the
same fate in the year 1780.&mdash;Yesterday I received from New Jersey a
Copy of your friendly Letter of the 1st February: a Copy, I say, for
my wife, or some one of my four Girls, daughters, would not forward
me the original, but keep it until my return for fear of accidents.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning I embark again for Monmouth, and among
other cares, when I arrive at my magical grove, I shall hasten to exert
all the poetical energy I possess, on the grand Subject of the Repulse of
the British Army from New Orleans. There is a subject indeed! far
above my power, I fear. If there be anything in inspiration, it will be
needful on such a theme. Eight hundred lines in Heroic Measure I
mean to devote to this animating subject.&mdash;In due time you shall hear
more from me on this business, if I am not anticipated by some one
more muse beloved than myself.&mdash;Hoping that all health and happiness
may attend you, and that your libraries in future may escape the ravages
and flames of Goths and Barbarians&mdash;I remain, etc."</p></div>

<p>Madison's reply has been lost. On May 10, 1815,
Freneau wrote his last letter, as far as we know, to
Madison:<a name="FNanchor_27_29" id="FNanchor_27_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_29" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The 1815 edition contains no poems previously
published in the poet's earlier collections. The work
shows no falling off in vigor from the earlier martial
standard set by the poet in his more vigorous years.
Some critics have declared that the poet's best work is
in this collection. Certain it is that a few of the lyrics
of battle have a spirit and swing that make them notable
productions.</p>

<p>Freneau placed upon the title-page the ringing
challenge:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then England come!&mdash;a sense of wrong requires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet with thirteen stars your thousand fires:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through these stern times the conflict to maintain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drown them, with your commerce, in the main."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He introduced the work as follows:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The poetical pieces contained in these volumes were composed
at different periods, and on a variety of occasions, between the years
1797 and 1815, and are now presented to the public, printed from the
author's original and corrected manuscripts, and, it is hoped, in such a
style of typography, as will not be unacceptable to the reader.&mdash;Several
of the performances, comprised in this collection, and chiefly those on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</a></span>
political subjects, and other events of the times, have heretofore appeared
in several periodical publications of <i>this</i> and other <span class="smcap">States</span> of the union.
It is presumed, however, that the poems of this description will not be
the less acceptable to the friends of the muses, now they are collected
in these volumes; with the advantage of having at one view what were
before scattered in those bulky vehicles of information, whose principal
object can be little more than to record the common events and business
of the day, and soon descend into comparative oblivion.&mdash;Whatever
may be the fate of the work, they are respectfully offered to the world,
in hopes it may obtain a share of their attention, and particularly, from
the friends of poetical composition; and in a country where it may be
expected, the fine arts in general will, with the return of peace, find that
share of encouragement, which they seem entitled to demand, in every
nation that makes any pretensions to refinement and civilization.&mdash;It is
only necessary to add, that care has been taken to execute the typographical
part as <i>correctly</i> as possible."</p></div>

<p>The poems were reviewed for the <i>Analectic Magazine</i>
by Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck, who said in part:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"He depicts land battles and naval fights with much animation
and gay coloring; and being himself a son of old Neptune, he is never
at a loss ... when the scene lies at sea. His martial and political
ballads are free from bombast and affectation, and often have an arch
simplicity in their manner that renders them very poignant and striking.
If the ballads and songs of Dibdin have cheered the spirits and incited
the valor of the British tars, the strains of Freneau, in like manner, are
calculated to impart patriotic impulses to the hearts of his countrymen,
and their effect in this way should be taken as the test of their merit,
without entering into a very nice examination of the rhyme or the
reason. For our own part, we have no inclination to dwell on his
defects; we had much rather&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The last years of Freneau's life were eventless,
passed quietly at Mount Pleasant, and varied only with
frequent visits to New York. Shortly after the issue
of the 1815 edition of his poems, the ancestral home
was completely destroyed by fire, together with most
of the poet's papers, manuscript poems, valuable letters
and books&mdash;the collection of a lifetime. During his
last years he contemplated a complete and final edition
of his poetical works. He wrote Dr. Mease of Philadelphia
whether there was "enough of the old spirit
of patriotism abroad to insure the safety of such an
adventure;" and it was the testimony of Alexander
Anderson, the once celebrated engraver on wood, that
Freneau once consulted with him as to the cost of an
illustrated volume of his poems, and departed sadly
remarking that his purse was not equal to the venture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span></p>

<p>The best picture of the poet in his old age is from
the pen of the genial Dr. John W. Francis of New
York, who knew him well during his last years:<a name="FNanchor_28_30" id="FNanchor_28_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_30" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"I had, when very young, read the poetry of Freneau, and as we
instinctively become attached to the writers who first captivate our
imaginations, it was with much zest that I formed a personal acquaintance
with the revolutionary bard. He was at that time about seventy-six
years old, when he first introduced himself to me in my library. I
gave him an earnest welcome. He was somewhat below the ordinary
height; in person thin yet muscular, with a firm step, though a little
inclined to stoop; his countenance wore traces of care, yet lightened
with intelligence as he spoke; he was mild in enunciation, neither rapid
nor slow, but clear, distinct, and emphatic. His forehead was rather
beyond the medium elevation, his eyes a dark grey, occupying a socket
deeper than common; his hair must have once been beautiful, it was
now thinned and of an iron grey. He was free of all ambitious displays;
his habitual expression was pensive. His dress might have
passed for that of a farmer. New York, the city of his birth, was his
most interesting theme; his collegiate career with Madison, next. His
story of many of his occasional poems was quite romantic. As he had
at command types and a printing press, when an incident of moment in
the Revolution occurred, he would retire for composition, or find shelter
under the shade of some tree, indite his lyrics, repair to the press, set up
his types, and issue his productions. There was no difficulty in versification
with him. I told him what I had heard Jeffrey, the Scotch
Reviewer, say of his writings, that the time would arrive when his
poetry, like that of Hudibras, would command a commentator like Gray.
On some of the occasions when Freneau honored me with a visit, we
had within our circle one of my earliest friends, that rare Knickerbocker,
Gulian C. Verplanck. I need not add that the charm of my
interview with the bard was heightened by the rich funds of antiquarian
lore possessed by the latter.</p>

<p>"It is remarkable how tenaciously Freneau preserved the acquisitions
of his early classical studies, notwithstanding he had for many
years, in the after portion of his life, been occupied in pursuits so
entirely alien to books. There is no portrait of the patriot Freneau;
he always firmly declined the painter's art, and would brook no 'counterfeit
presentiment.'"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</a></span></p>

<p>Freneau's frequent visits to New York were the
chief solace of his last years. Says Dr. Francis:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Freneau was widely known to a large circle of our most prominent
and patriotic New Yorkers. His native city, with all his wanderings,
was ever uppermost in his mind and in his affections. While in
the employment of Jefferson, as a translator in the department of state,
upon the organization of Congress, with Washington at its head, he had
the gratification of witnessing the progress of improvement, and might
have enjoyed increased facilities had he not enlisted with an indiscreet
zeal as an advocate of the radical doctrines of the day. Freneau was,
nevertheless, esteemed a true patriot; and his private worth, his courteous
manner, and his general bearing won admiration with all parties.
His pen was more acrimonious than his heart. He was tolerant, frank
in expression, and not deficient in geniality. He was highly cultivated
in classical knowledge, abounding in anecdotes of the revolutionary
crisis, and extensively acquainted with prominent characters.</p>

<p>"It were easy to record a long list of eminent citizens who ever
gave him a cordial welcome. He was received with the warmest greetings
by the old soldier, Governor George Clinton. He, also, in the
intimacy of kindred feeling, found an agreeable pastime with the learned
Provoost, the first regularly consecrated Bishop of the American Protestant
Episcopate, who himself had shouldered a musket in the Revolution,
and hence was sometimes called the fighting bishop. They
were allied by classical tastes, a love of natural science, and ardor in
the cause of liberty. With Gates he compared the achievements of
Monmouth with those at Saratoga. With Col. Fish he reviewed the
capture of Yorktown; with Dr. Mitchell he rehearsed, from his own
sad experience, the physical sufferings and various diseases of the incarcerated
patriots of the Jersey prison-ship; and descanted on Italian
poetry and the piscatory eclogues of Sannazarius. He, doubtless, furnished
Dr. Benjamin Dewitt with data for his funeral discourse on the
remains of the 11,500 American martyrs. With Pintard he could laud
Horace and talk largely of Paul Jones. With Major Fairlie he discussed
the tactics and chivalry of Baron Steuben. With Sylvanus
Miller he compared notes on the political clubs of 1795-1810. With
Dewitt Clinton and Cadwallader D. Colden he debated the projects
of internal improvement and artificial navigation, based on the famous
precedent of the Languedoc canal."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Freneau was a sad one. On the
evening of the 18th of December, 1832, he had gone on
an errand to Freehold, some two miles distant. When
he set out to return, late in the evening, a fierce and
blinding storm was in progress. His friends sought to
dissuade him, but he insisted on returning. Instead of
taking the long way round by the road, he took the
usual short way through the fields, and was soon lost
in the roaring "blizzard." He circled into a swamp,
and doubtless, after hours of wandering, sank down
benumbed and hopeless, to be found by his friends a
few hours later, still breathing but nearly lifeless. For
the whispered tradition that he was intoxicated when
he left the town, there is no foundation.</p>

<p>The next issue of the <i>Monmouth Press</i> contained a
notice of his death:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Mr. Freneau was in the village and started, towards evening, to
go home, about two miles. In attempting to go across he appears to
have got lost and mired in a bog where his lifeless corpse was discovered
yesterday morning. Captain Freneau was a stanch Whig in
the time of the Revolution, a good soldier, and a warm patriot. The
productions of his pen animated his countrymen in the darkest days of
'76 and the effusions of his muse cheered the desponding soldier as he
fought the battles of freedom."</p></div>

<p>His old friend, John Pintard, wrote a biographical
notice of the poet in the <i>New York Mirror</i> for January
12, 1833, in which he dwelt largely upon his mental
endowments and accomplishments:</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"He was a man of great reading and extensive acquirements; few
were more thoroughly versed in classical literature, and fewer still who
knew as much about the early history of our country, the organization
of the government, and the use and progress of parties."</p></div>

<p>The house which Freneau occupied during his last
years is still standing. His remains rest in the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</a></span>
cemetery at Mount Pleasant, which recently, in honor
of the poet, has been rechristened Freneau.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The personality of Philip Freneau, if we judge
from contemporary testimony and the effect which his
personal presence invariably exerted, was a singularly
winning one. The bluff, hearty old sailor breathed
out good-will and honesty with every breath. He was
the soul of honor, and, despite his caustic pen, the
kindest hearted creature in the world. All that one of
his grand-daughters can remember of him is that once
he took her upon his knee and chided her for having
killed a fly. "Surely," he said, "it was not made
without some wise end, and its little life was as dear to
him as is yours to you." It reminds one of "My
Uncle Toby." There is a cheery optimism in many of
his poems. A stanza like this might have been written
by Browning:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All nature must decay, 'tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nature shall her face renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her travels in a circle make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freeze but to thaw, sleep but to wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die but to live and live to die."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His temperament was Celtic. He inherited with
his French blood a passionate love for beauty, a sensuous,
dreamy delight in the merely poetic, in the weird
and romantic. He had not the Teutonic stability; he
was easily exalted, easily depressed; he went often to
extremes; he was sensitive to a degree that made criticism
a torture, and he was proud beyond all reason.
He had been deeply touched by the principles of the
Revolution; he had suffered personally at the hands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span>
the enemy; he had followed Paine in his democratic
doctrines even to the extremes, and he tried to live
consistently with these exalted ideals. His honesty
and his ignorance of the world prevented him from
seeing how greatly these principles must be modified
to become of really practical value.</p>

<p>His kindly heart made him a fierce foe to all
kinds of tyranny and oppression. He saw sights in
the West Indies that made him a bitter opponent of
human slavery. Again and again in his poems and
prose sketches does he condemn the evil. His message
is almost as intense as Whittier's:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O come the time and haste the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When man shall man no longer crush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When reason shall enforce her sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor these fair regions raise the blush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where still the African complains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourns his yet unbroken chains."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not only slavery, but every other form of oppression
and wrong received his condemnation. He wrote
boldly against intemperance in a day when the use of
intoxicating liquors was well-nigh universal and wholly
uncriticised; he spoke eloquently on cruelty to animals;
and he was one of the earliest to demand equal
rights for man and woman.</p>

<p>Freneau's religious inclinations have been sometimes
harshly criticised by those of puritanic creed.
The school of Dr. Dwight could speak of him only in
contempt, yet it is true that the poet was a deeply
religious man. His love of freedom and his perfect
sincerity affected his creed. He had an intense dislike
for hollow formalism. In his "Jamaica Funeral" he
has pictured a hypocritical priest in colors as vivid
almost as Chaucer's. He detested</p>

<p class="cblockquot">"The holy man by Bishops holy made."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[Pg xcviii]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">He loved sincerity, and the creed that came not from
dry formalism, but from reason and from an honest
heart.</p>

<p>It has often been overlooked by his critics that
Freneau was a widely read and thoroughly cultured
man; that he was a linguist of more than ordinary
powers; and that he knew intimately the chief writings
in Latin, Italian, French, and English. He was no
ignorant, careless scribbler, tossing into the ephemeral
columns of the press hasty rhymes of which he never
thought again. He revised and corrected with patient
care, and he took a deep interest in the children of his
pen, rescuing at one time or another almost every one
of them from the oblivion of the newspaper.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>As to the absolute literary value of Freneau's
literary remains, there is room for honest difference of
opinion. He is certainly not, if we judge him from
what he actually produced, a great poet. But he must
in fairness be viewed against the background of his age
and his environment. Nature had equipped him as she
has equipped few other men. He had the poet's creative
imagination; he had an exquisite sense of the
beautiful; and he had a realization of his own poetic
endowments that kept him during a long life constantly
true to the muse. Scarcely a month went by in all his
life, from his early boyhood, that was not marked by
poetic composition. Few poets, even in later and more
auspicious days, have devoted their lives more assiduously
to song.</p>

<p>Freneau was the first to catch what may be called
the new poetic impulse in America&mdash;the new epic note.
Previous to the Revolutionary era, America was destitute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</a></span>
even of the germs of an original literature. Before
she could produce anything really strong and individual,
there was necessary some great primal impulse
that should stir mightily the whole people; that should
strike from their hands the old books and the old
models; that should arouse them to a true realization
of themselves; and that should clear the atmosphere
for a new and broader view of human life. Such new
forces are always needed by society, but they stalk
with long strides over the centuries.</p>

<p>In pre-Revolutionary America such an upheaval
was near at hand. It came with appalling suddenness.
The colonists had had no gradual preparation for the
idea of separation from England. As late as 1775,
Franklin declared before the House of Commons that
in all of his journeyings up and down the colonies he
had not heard expressed one single wish for complete
independence. Even after Concord and Bunker Hill,
Freneau, the radical, could write:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Long may Britannia rule our hearts again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rule as she ruled in George the Second's reign."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The idea of independence came all in a moment;
but once it had come, it went with leaps and bounds to
its extreme. Never in all history has a whole people
been lifted by such rapid stages into a region of such
vast outlook. We can trace the growth of the new
spirit, not decade by decade, but month by month:
Justice, Freedom, Independence, and then the radiant
vision of perfect Liberty and the Rights of Man, and
then like a torrent the sense of boundless possibilities
and glorious destiny:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No pent-up Utica contracts our powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the whole boundless continent is ours."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</a></span>The soul of man stirred by such ideals, and successful
in realizing them beyond all dreams, struggled
for utterance. It is such upheavals in human society
that make poets and bring outbursts of song and
periods in the history of literature. But there was
no burst of song in America; instead there followed
one of the most pathetic spectacles in all literary history&mdash;a
people with a vision that transported them
into the clouds, yet powerless through environment
and early education to transmute that vision into song.
The South, thrilled by the new spirit, turned it at
once into action, and took the leadership in war and
statesmanship. New England lifted up her voice, but
she could speak only through the medium of old spiritual
conceptions and worn-out poetic forms. A young
Connecticut parson, thrilled through and through,
pours his enthusiasm into an epic of the wars of Joshua
done in the heroics of Pope; a brilliant Boston lad
would sing of "War and Washington," but he must
set it to the tune of Dryden; and a gifted Connecticut
satirist, overflowing with the true poetic spirit, is content
simply to add new American stanzas to "Hudibras."
With all her rhymers and all her inspiration,
New England gave forth not a single original note. It
was the repeating of the old spectacle of a heavenly
anthem sung unto shepherds,&mdash;unto those utterly
unable to give it utterance.</p>

<p>We see them, however, struggling heroically with
the burden. From 1774, when Dwight completed his
"Conquest of Canaan," "the first piece of this kind
ever attempted in this country," as he observed in his
preface, until 1808, which ends the period with Barlow's
"Columbiad"&mdash;the "Polyolbion" of American
poetry&mdash;the years are strewn thick with the wrecks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[Pg ci]</a></span>
epics. Every poet of the era felt his soul burn with
the epic fire. Charles Brockden Brown, when only
sixteen, had started no less than three of these Homeric
efforts: one on the discovery of America, and one each
on the conquests of Mexico and Peru. It was our
heroic era, but it yielded almost nothing of value.
Mere exaltation availeth little unless it be grounded
either upon genius or long-continued culture.</p>

<p>America, however, was not without her genius.
Before Dwight and Barlow and Trumbull had written
a line, Freneau at Princeton was planning epics American
in scene and spirit. He had dreamed, over his
Virgil, of a greater Aeneas who had sailed into the
pathless West to discover a new world, and to plant
there the seeds of a greater than Rome; he had translated
with beating heart the words of Seneca:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The time shall come, when numerous years are past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ocean shall unloose the bands of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an extended region rise at last;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And Typhis shall disclose the mighty land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far away, where none have rov'd before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall the world's remotest region be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gibraltar's rock, or Thule's savage shore."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"Fired at the theme," he had mapped out the
epic of a new world; but his work of this era, like all
schoolboy epics, had resulted only in fragments which
were to strew his earlier volumes. How strong and
original was this youthful dream one can judge from
the ringing lines of "Columbus to Ferdinand," "Discovery,"
and the "Pictures of Columbus," which are
mere epic fragments. There is an originality and a
fire in them utterly new in American poetry. There is
poetry of a high order in such a climax as that recording
the soliloquy of the dying Columbus, beginning:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[Pg cii]</a></span></p>

<p>But Commencement was at hand. Here was a
chance, indeed; here was a theme commensurate with
the occasion. The two young dreamers would outline
an epic poem; they would essay "Things unattempted
yet in prose or rhyme":</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Never was graduating exercise based on broader
foundations. The young graduates bewail at every
step their limitations of space. The plan they suggest
is the plan of a "Columbiad." They would begin
with all the tale of Columbus; they would rehearse
the story of Cortez and Pizarro; they would discuss
at learned length the origin and the characteristics of
the Indians; they would tell the story of the early
colonies; and would trace the course of settlement and
review the progress and the promise of agriculture and
commerce; they would peer into the future and mark
the time</p>

<p>But, alas, the time! An epic cannot be condensed

</div>

<p>It is not a great poem when we measure it by absolute
standards, but "The Rising Glory of America" is
a very great poem if we view it in connection with
the conditions and the environment that produced it.
Full as it is of Latin influence and Commencement day
zeal, it is the first real poem that America ever made&mdash;the
first poem that was impelled hot from a man's soul.
It is more than this, it is the first real fruit of a new
influence in the world of letters&mdash;the first literary product
of that mighty force that was to set in motion the
American and French Revolutions, with all that they
mean in human history.</p>

<p>America should have recognized this new and
original voice, and should have encouraged it to sing
the new message which it had to proclaim to the world,
but she was not yet ready.</p>

<p>How the young dreamer, who had seen life from
his earliest years only through the medium of his
books, was gradually disillusioned, we have endeavored
to show. His first book, put forth in the enthusiasm
of inexperience, with his name on the title-page,
was "damned by all good and judicious judges." So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</a></span>
was Wordsworth's; so have been the earliest ventures
of every innovator in the field of song. Gradually the
young poet awoke to a realization of his position:
America was unprepared for her prophet; she would
not listen. The discovery disheartened him; his Celtic
temperament would not patiently wait for recognition,
as did Wordsworth; he was too proud to force his
poetry upon an unwilling public. He would leave the
scene, for three years to dwell in the dreamy seclusion
of the tropic islands.</p>

<p>This was his period of pure invention, where he
showed the possibilities of his genius. With the
"House of Night" he became one of the earliest pioneers
in that dimly-lighted region which was soon to
be exploited by Coleridge and Poe. The poem is the
first distinctly romantic note heard in America. Moreover,
one may search in vain in the English poetry of
the early romantic movement for anything that can
equal it in strength of conception, in mastery of weird
epithet, and in sustained command over the vaguely
terrible. The page that recounts the poet's departure
from the house of night, quaking with fear,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beneath my feet substantial darkness lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And screams were heard from the distempered ground,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">his timid look behind him to find the windows of the
infernal dome a "flaming hell-red," the fearful shrieks
of the dying monster within the walls, the "hell-red
wandering light" that led him to the graves, the sudden
peal of the iron bell above him in the darkness,
and then the troop of spectres galloping fiercely on
Death's horses, while "their busy eyes shot terror to
my soul,"&mdash;all this is worthy of Poe. As a product
of pure imagination, the poem is most remarkable,
especially when we view it in connection with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</a></span>
English literature of its day. In its weird supernaturalism
it anticipated Scott, and in its unearthly atmosphere
it clearly anticipated Coleridge.</p>

<p>In the "Jamaica Funeral" the poet outlined his
early philosophy of life. He was fast breaking from
the influence of Gray, his early master. It is a Gallic
philosophy that he outlines; he is becoming infected
with Deism; he is a true bacchanalian. Is there not
a ring of the "Rubaiyat" in a stanza like this:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Count all the trees that crown Jamaica's hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count all the stars that through the heavens you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count every drop that the wide ocean fills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then count the pleasures Bacchus yields to me?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Freneau's early dream of a purely poetic career
was rudely broken by the sudden clash of war and by
the sternly practical nature of the American people.
Circumstances decided for him his career. There was
needed a poetic voice to arouse the common people to
action. There was no demand for an imaginative creator,
for a sensuous singer of love and wine,&mdash;America
needed a popular voice, one that could be understood
by the unlettered, one that with satire and patriotic
appeal could arouse and fire the land. Freneau laid
aside for a time the harp and the lyre and took up the
trumpet and the bagpipes, and of his influence on the
stormy period of the Revolution there can be no two
opinions. His ballads and satires were scattered far
and wide; they were sold in broadsides in every port
and city and camp. Even in the war of 1812 his poems
flew like leaves everywhere that men were gathered
together. To be the lyrist of a righteous revolution,
and above all to be the people's poet, is in itself no
small distinction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[Pg cvi]</a></span></p>

<p>His poems of the war are in themselves a running
history of the struggle, especially of its last years.
His heart was in his work; the prison ship had blotted
for a time all memories of the old criticisms of his early
work, all his early dreams, everything save "the insulting
foe" who was making desolate his dear mother
land. He lampooned without mercy Clinton, Cornwallis,
Carleton, and the royalist printers, Rivington
and Gaine. He sang tender lyrics of the patriot dead
at Eutaw Springs, who</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Saw their injured Country's woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flaming town, the wasted field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rushed to meet the insulting foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took the spear,&mdash;but left the shield."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">He sang peans of victory over the downfall at Yorktown;
he exalted the fame of Washington; he called
down maledictions on the ship that bore the "worthless
Arnold" from American shores. These are more
than the fleeting voices of a newspaper muse; they are
true poems, and they are American to the core. Scott
declared that "Eutaw Springs [was] as fine a thing as
there is of the kind in the language."</p>

<p>With a few fiery songs he placed himself at the
head of the small group of naval lyrists, a position
which even to-day he has not wholly lost. In dash and
fire, in ability to catch and reproduce the odors and the
atmosphere of the ocean, in enthusiasm and excitement
that is contagious and that plunges the reader at once
into the heart of the action, and in glowing patriotism
that makes the poems national hymns, no American
poet has excelled this earliest singer of the American
ocean. No true patriot can read without a thrill of
pride such songs as "Captain Jones's Invitation" and
"The Death of Captain Biddle," a song of the intrepid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg cvii]</a></span>seaman who from the <i>Randolph</i> poured death into the
British ship:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tremendous flash! and hark, the ball<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drives through old Yarmouth, flames and all,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">and then in a fatal moment was blown up by his own
magazine, and "Stanzas on the New Frigate Alliance,"
the gallant ship "who walks the ocean like
its queen," and "Barney's Victory over the General
Monk," that rollicking song of battle and of triumph,
and best of all, perhaps, "The Sailor's Invitation,"
which is full of the very salt and vigor of the western
seas. "The Memorable Victory of Paul Jones," written
when America was ringing with the first news of
the battle, is one of the glories of American literature.
Longfellow or Whittier never wrote a more stirring
ballad. It moves with leaps and bounds; it is full of
the very spirit of battle.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She felt the fury of her ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down, prostrate down, the Britons fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The decks are strew'd with slain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jones to the foe his vessel lash'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the black artillery flash'd<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Loud thunders shook the main."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">It is not impertinent to observe that Thomas Campbell
was but four years of age when this appeared.
It was not Scott or Cooper who added the domain of
the ocean to literature; it was Freneau. His books
are full of the roar and the sweep of the open sea,
which he knew as the farmer knows his ancestral acres.
There is no more true and vigorous picture of an
ocean voyage and a naval combat than that contained
in Canto I of "The British Prison Ship." The episode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</a></span>of the boatswain's fiery prayer, just before the conflict,
is unique in literature.</p>

<p>The war over, Freneau would return to his dream;
he would pour forth the poetic message that was in
him; but his countrymen, delighting in his hard blows
and biting sarcasm, refused to listen to the merely
poetic. They demanded jingles and clever hits. The
poet turned fiercely upon them. "For men I keep
a pen," he cried, "for dogs a cane." The time for
using the cane was past; he would use it no more.
But who would listen to anything that was not rant
and bombast? Fate had thrown him into a "bard-baiting
clime." A wave of the old bitterness swept
over him:</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Expect not in these times of rude renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That verse like yours will have the chance to please:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No taste for plaintive elegy is known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lyric ode,&mdash;none care for things like these."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">How he at length deliberately turned from the muse
of his choice, and how after a long experience with the
world of actual affairs he exchanged his old poetic
ideals for those of mere reason and common sense, we
have attempted to show.</p>

<p>Here was a man equipped by nature for a true
poet, a man with a message, yet dwarfed and transformed
by his environment. America was not ready
for her singer. It took half a century more to make
way in the wilderness for the new message that had
been whispered to Freneau in his young manhood.
Had he been a great world-poet, he would have been
heard despite all difficulties; he would have trampled
down the barriers about him and have compelled his
age to listen, but the task was beyond him. America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[Pg cix]</a></span>
to this day, has produced no poet who single-handed
and alone could have performed such a labor of Hercules.
Sadly Freneau turned to other things.</p>

<p>He has never been adequately recognized. Had
the first edition of his poems, published the same year
as the Kilmarnock edition of Burns, been an English
book, it long ago would have figured largely in the
histories of the romantic and naturalistic movement
which made possible the great outburst of the nineteenth
century. That Freneau was the most conspicuous
pioneer in the dim romantic world that was to
be explored by Coleridge and Poe, we have already
shown; that he was a pioneer in the movement that
succeeded in throwing off the chain forged by Pope
is evident to any one who will examine his early work.
"The Wild Honey Suckle," for instance, which was
written in 1786, twelve years before the "Lyrical Ballads,"
is as spontaneous and as free from Pope as anything
written by Wordsworth. It is a nature lyric
written with the eye upon the object, without recollection
of other poetry, and it draws from the humble
flower a lesson for humanity in the true Wordsworthian
manner. Before Freneau, American poetry had been
full of the eglantine, the yew, the Babylonian willow,
the lark&mdash;the flora and fauna of the Hebrew and British
bards. In our poet we find, for the first time, the
actual life of the American forest and field&mdash;the wild
pink, the elm, the wild honeysuckle, the pumpkin,
the blackbird, the squirrel, the partridge, "the loquacious
whip-poor-will," and in addition to this the varied
life of the American tropic islands. We find for the
first time examples of that true poetic spirit that can
find inspiration in humble and even vulgar things;
that, furthermore, can draw from lowly nature and her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx">[Pg cx]</a></span>commonplaces deep lessons for human life. Freneau
sees the reflection of the stars in the bosom of the river,</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But when the tide had ebbed away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene fantastic with it fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bank of mud around me lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sea-weed on the river's bed,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">and from this he draws the obvious moral for human
life. Consider what Pope would have said of mud.
Indeed, to appreciate Freneau, one must come to him
after a careful reading of the classic poets who preceded
him. What a shock to this school would have
been the vividly realistic poem on "Logtown." Just
how much Freneau influenced the school of poets who
in England broke away from the trammels of the eighteenth
century, we can never know; yet no one can
read long in the American poet and not be convinced
that his influence was considerable. His poems were
known and read freely in England at the very dawn of
the critical period in British poetry, and their echoes
can be detected more than once.</p>

<p>In his use of his native land and his familiar surroundings
as a background for art, Freneau discovered
the poetical side of the Indian, and thus became
the literary father of Brockden Brown, Cooper, and
the little school of poets which in the early years of
the century fondly believed that the aboriginal American
was to be the central figure in the poetry of the
new world. To the little real poetry that there is
in the Indian, Freneau did full justice, but he went to
no such absurd lengths as did Eastburn and Whittier.
The "Indian Death Song," if it indeed be his, is full
of the wild, stoical heroism of the brave who is dying
beneath the torture of his enemies. In "The Indian
Student" he has covered fully the Indian's love for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[Pg cxi]</a></span>the pathless forest, and to the untamable wildness of
his nature. "The Dying Indian" and "The Indian
Burying-Ground" sum up what is essentially poetic
in Indian legend and all that is pathetic in the fate of
the vanishing race. Poetry, if it is to confine itself
to the truth, can do little more for the Indian.</p>

<p>Such was Philip Freneau, a man in every respect
worthy to bear the title of "the father of American
poetry." He was the first true poet born upon our
continent; he realized in his early youth his vocation;
he gave himself with vigor and enthusiasm to his
calling; he fitted himself by wide reading and classic
culture; he received the full inspiration of a great
movement in human society; he lifted up his voice to
sing, but he was smothered and silenced by his contemporaries.
He was all alone; he had about him
no circle of "Pleiades" to encourage and assist; he
had no traditions, religious or otherwise, that would
compel silence. He was out of step with the theology
of his generation; he was out of tune with the music
of his day; he was beating time a half century ahead of
the chorus about him. The people have to be educated
to revolution, and America had not yet learned
to take the initiative in things intellectual and &aelig;sthetic.
She must follow the literary fashions beyond the sea.
Freneau was for breaking violently away from England
and for setting up a new standard of culture and
literary art on this side the water.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Can we never be thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have learning or grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless it be brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that damnable place?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noidt">he cried. But he reckoned without his countrymen.
Not until Emerson's day did it dawn upon America
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</a></span>that it was possible for her to think for herself and
make poetry that did not echo the English bards.
Thus did America reject her earliest prophet; thus
did she stop her ears and compel him to lay aside
his seven-stringed lyre for the horn and the bagpipes.</p>

<p>Freneau lived to see his discarded harp in full tune
in other hands, first in England and then in his own
land. There is something truly pathetic in the figure
of the old minstrel, who had realized almost nothing
of his early dreams, and yet who had been told by the
great Jeffries that the time would surely come when
his poems would command a commentator like Gray,
who had been extravagantly praised by such masters
as Scott and Campbell, who had written to Madison as
late as 1815, "my publisher tells me the town will have
them [his verses] and of course have them they will,"
it is pathetic to see this poet, in his hoary old age, for
he lived until 1832, realizing that he had been utterly
forgotten, witnessing the triumph of the very songs
that had haunted his youth, and seeing those who had
not half his native ability crowned by those who had
rejected and forgotten him. Such ever is the penalty
of being born out of due time.</p>

<p>The present age has also been unjust to Freneau.
It has left his poems in their first editions, which are
now extremely rare and costly; it has scattered his
letters and papers to the winds; it has garbled and
distorted his life in every book of reference; it has left
untold the true story of his career; it has judged him
from generalizations that have floated from no one
knows where. But time works slowly with her verdicts;
true merit in the end is sure to receive its
deserts; and Freneau may even yet be given the place
that is his.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In ages past, when smit with warmth sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bards foretold the dark events of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piercing forward through the mystic shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings yet to come, and chiefs unborn survey'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amittai's son perceiv'd, among the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty flame usurp his labouring breast:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, in dreams, the voice unerring came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Him, who lives through every age the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Arise! and o'er the intervening waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To Nineveh's imperial turrets haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That mighty town to ruin I decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Proclaim destruction, and proclaim from me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Too long it stands, to God and man a foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Without one virtue left to shield the blow;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Guilt, black as night, their speedy ruin brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And hottest vengeance from the King of Kings."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prophet heard&mdash;but dared to disobey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Weak as he was) and fled a different way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Joppa's port a trading ship he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far o'er the main to distant Tarshish bound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price of passage to her chief he paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there conceal'd with wandering sailors stay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purpose fixt, at once perverse and blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave his country, and his God behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But He who spread the ocean's vast expanse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And views all nature with a single glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from its prison bade the tempest fly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest swell'd the ocean to the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling barque, as the fierce billow knocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce bears the fury of repeated shocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crew distrest, astonish'd and afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each to his various god in anguish pray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor trust alone to penitence and prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They clear the decks, and for the worst prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The costly lading to the deep they throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lighter o'er the billows she may go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with regret the wealthy cargo spared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wealth is nothing when with life compared.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But to the ship's remotest chambers fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There pensive Jonah droop'd his languid head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, new to all the dangers of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sunk, dejected, in the arms of sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas then the master broke the prophet's rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus exclaim'd, and smote his frantic breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O sleeper, from thy stupid slumbers rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"At such an hour can sleep invade thine eyes?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If ever thou to heaven didst send a prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now send thy warmest supplications there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Perhaps thy God may pity our distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And save us, foundering in this dark abyss."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus warn'd, the seer his vows repentant paid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the seamen to their fellows said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No common waves our shatter'd vessel rend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There must be one for whom these storms impend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Some wretch we bear, for whom these billows rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Foe to the gods, and hated by the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, since the billows all our arts defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, let the lot decide for whom we die."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Instant the lots amidst the vase they threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the markt lot dejected Jonah drew!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then thus their chief the guilty man address'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Say, for what crime of thine are we distrest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is thy country, what thy calling, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whence dost thou come, what potentate obey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Unfold it all, nor be the truth deny'd."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master spoke, and Jonah thus reply'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A Hebrew I, from neighbouring regions came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A Jewish prophet, of no vulgar fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That God I fear who spread this raging sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who fixt the shores by his supreme decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And reigns throughout immeasurable space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"His footstool earth, the heaven his dwelling place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But I, regardless of his high command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"His mandate slighting, fled my native land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fool that I was, from Joppa's port to fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who thought to shun his all-pervading eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For this the tempest rends each tatter'd sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For this your vessel scarce supports the gale!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The seamen heard, distracted and dismay'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus again their trembling pilot said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How couldst thou thus, ungenerous as thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Affront thy patron, and with us depart?&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo! for thy crimes, and not our own, we die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mark, how the wild waves threaten from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Our sails in fragments flit before the blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Scarce to its station we confine the mast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What shall we do, unhappy man, declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How shall we act, or how direct our prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That angry Neptune may his rage restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And hush once more these tumults of the main?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The seer reply'd, "The means are in your power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To still the tempest in this dreadful hour:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"High on the sea-beat prow will I ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And let the boldest of your crew attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To plunge me headlong from that giddy steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Down to the bosom of the unfathom'd deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"So shall the ocean from its raging cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And the fierce tempest soon be hush'd to peace:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis for my crimes this angry ocean raves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis for my sin we plough these fearful waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dislodge me soon&mdash;the storm shall then decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Which still grows louder while on board I stay."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus he&mdash;but they, to save their vagrant guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refus'd as yet to grant his strange request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though aloft on mountain waves they ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tost galley reels from side to side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to their breasts they drew the sweepy oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly strove to gain the distant shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruffian winds refuse that wish'd retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiercer o'er the decks the billows beat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then to the skies the chief his prayer addrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou Jove supreme, the greatest and the best!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because thy sovereign pleasure doth require<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That death alone must satisfy thine ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O spare us for thy dying prophet's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor let us perish for the life we take;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If we are wrong, his lot was thy decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And thou hast done as it seem'd best to thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then from the summit of the washy prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They plunged the prophet to the depths below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straight the winds, and straight the billows cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every threatening surge lay hush'd in peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling crew adore the Power Supreme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who kindly thus from ruin rescued them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vows they send to his imperial throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And victims offer to this God unknown.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When from the prow's intimidating height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They plung'd the prophet to the realms of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long he languished in the briny deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In death's cold arms not yet decreed to sleep.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jehovah saw him, from the abodes of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk to the bottom of the vast abyss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade a whale, the mightiest of the kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His prophet in these dismal mansions find&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hostile form, approaching through the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receiv'd him living to a living grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where three long days in dark distress he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft repenting, to his God did pray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power benign, propitious to his prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade the huge fish to neighbouring shores repair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant the whale obey'd the high command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast him safe on Palestina's strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prophet then his past transgressions mourn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grateful, thus to heaven his thanks return'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Afflicted from the depths of hell I pray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The dark abyss of everlasting shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My God in mercy heard the earnest prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And dying Jonah felt thy presence there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because I dared thy mandate disobey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Far didst thou plunge me from the face of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In the vast ocean, where no land is found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The mighty waters closed thy prophet round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"On me the waves their utmost fury spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And all thy billows o'er my body went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet then, surrounded by the dismal shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thus to my Maker from the depths I said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Though hid beneath the caverns of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To thy blest temple will I look again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Though from thy sight to utter darkness thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Still will I trust, and trust on thee alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With anguish deep I felt the billows roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Scarce in her mansion stay'd my frighted soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"About my head were wrapt the weeds of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And darkness, mingled with no ray of light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I reached the caves the briny ocean fills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I reached the bases of the infernal hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Earth, with her bars, encompass'd me around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet, from the bottom of that dark profound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where life no more the swelling vein supplies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And death reposes, didst thou bid me rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When fainting nature bow'd to thy decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And the lone spirit had prepar'd to flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then from my prison I remember'd thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My prayer towards thy heavenly temple came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The temple sacred to Jehovah's name.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Unhappy they, who vanities pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And lies believing, their own souls undo&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But to thine ear my grateful song shall rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For thee shall smoke the atoning sacrifice,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once more the voice to humbled Jonah came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Him, who lives through every age the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Arise! and o'er the intervening waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To Nineveh's exalted turrets haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And what to thee my Spirit shall reveal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That preach&mdash;nor dare the sacred truth conceal&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To desolation I that town decree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Proclaim destruction, and proclaim from me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient to Jehovah's high command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophet rose, and left Judea's land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he near the spiry city drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Euphrates pass'd, and rapid Tigris too:)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So vast the bulk of this prodigious place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days were scant its lengthy streets to trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as he enter'd, on the first sad day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he began his tidings of dismay:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O Nineveh! to heaven's decree attend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet forty days, and all thy glories end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet forty days, the skies protract thy fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And desolation then shall bury all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy proudest towers their utter ruin mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And domes and temples unextinguished burn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Nineveh! the God of armies dooms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy thousand streets to never-ending glooms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Through mouldering fanes the hollow winds shall roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And vultures scream where monarchy lodg'd before!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy guilty sons shall bow beneath the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy captive matrons own a foreign lord.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Such is the vengeance that the heavens decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Such is the ruin that must bury thee!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The people heard, and smit with instant fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believ'd the fatal warnings of the seer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sudden ruin so their souls distrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each with sackcloth did his limbs invest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him that glitter'd on the regal throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him that did beneath the burden groan.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon to their monarch came this voice of fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who left his throne and costly robes of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er his limbs a vest of sackcloth drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sate in ashes, sorrowful to view&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lords and nobles, now repentant grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal grief their various sins bemoan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the city sent this loud decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With threatening back'd, and dreadful penalty:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Ye Ninevites! your wonted food refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor touch, ye beasts, the herbage of the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let all that live be humbled to the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor taste the waters, though ye die of thirst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let men and beasts the garb of sorrow wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And beg yon' skies these guilty walls to spare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let all repent the evil they pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And curse the mischief that their hands would do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Perhaps that God, who leans to mercy still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And sent a prophet to declare his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"May yet the vengeance he designs, adjourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And, ere we perish, from his anger turn."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Jehovah heard, and pleas'd beheld at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their deep repentance for transgressions past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pity moved, he heard the earnest prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this vast city, humbled in despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though justly due, his anger dies away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bids the angel of destruction stay:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The obedient angel hears the high command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheathes the sword, he drew to smite the land.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And God's own bolts the tottering towers assail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And millions perish, than his word should fail.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Vain, impious man, to send such pinings there):<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"While yet within my native land, I stay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This would at last reward my toil, I said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"O take my life, so wretched and unblest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If here I stay, 'tis but to grieve and sigh;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Is it thy place to swell with rage and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"(Thus to his pining prophet, God reply'd)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Say is it just thy heart should burn with ire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because yon' city is not wrapt in fire?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Waiting the issue of the fortieth day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yet uncertain if the Power Divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or would to mercy, or to wrath incline&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the leaves that roof'd his arbour o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrunk up and faded, sheltered him no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But God ordain'd a thrifty gourd to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To screen his prophet from the scorching skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er his head aspired the spreading leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too fondly meant to mitigate his grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So close a foliage o'er his head was made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That not a beam could pierce the happy shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondering seer perceiv'd the branches grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless'd the shadow that reliev'd his woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when the next bright morn began to shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So God ordain'd) a worm attack'd the vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his bite its goodly leaves decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wasting, withering, die before the day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then as the lamp of heaven still higher rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From eastern skies a sultry tempest blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vertic sun as fiercely pour'd his ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beam'd around insufferable day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beat those beams on Jonah's fainting head!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft he wish'd a place among the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All he could do, was now to grieve and sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life detest, and beg of God to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Again, Jehovah to his prophet said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou so angry for thy vanish'd shade&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For a mere shadow dost thou well to grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For this poor loss would'st thou thy being leave?"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"My rage is just, (the frantic prophet cry'd),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My last, my only comfort is deny'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The spreading vine that form'd my leafy bower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Behold it vanish'd in the needful hour!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To beating winds and sultry suns a prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My fainting spirit droops and dies away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give me a mansion in my native dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For though I die with rage, my rage is just."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more the Almighty deign'd to make reply&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Does this lost <i>gourd</i> thy sorrow swell so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Whose</i> friendly shade not to thy toil was due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Alone it sprouted and alone it grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A night beheld its branches waving high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And the next sun beheld those branches die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And should not pity move the Lord of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To spare the vast Assyrian capital,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Within whose walls uncounted myriads stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Their Father I, my sinful offspring they?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Should they not move the creating mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With six score thousand of the infant kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And herds untold that graze the spacious field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For whom yon' meads their stores of fragrance yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Should I this royal city wrap in flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And slaughter millions to support thy fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When now repentant to their God they turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And their past follies, low in ashes, mourn?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Vain, thoughtless wretch, recall thy weak request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Death never came to man a welcome guest;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why wish to die&mdash;what madness prompts thy mind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Too long the days of darkness thou shalt find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Life was a blessing by thy Maker meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dost thou despise the blessings he has lent&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Enjoy my gifts while yet the seasons run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"True to their months, and social with the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When to the dust my mandate bids thee fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All these are lost, for death conceals them all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No more the sun illumes the sprightly day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The seasons vanish, and the stars decay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The trees, the flowers, no more thy sense delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Death shades them all in ever-during night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then think not long the little space I lent&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of thy own sins, like Nineveh, repent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rejoice at last the mighty change to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And bear with them as I have borne with thee."<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">Preliminary Particulars</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sprung from a race that had long till'd the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first disrobed it of its native trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wish'd to heir their lands, but not their toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought the ploughman's life no life of ease;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Tis wrong (said he) these pretty hands to wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With felling oaks, or delving in the ground:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I, who at least have forty pounds in cash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And in a country store might cut a dash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why should I till these barren fields (he said)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I who have learnt to cypher, write and read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"These fields that shrubs, and weeds, and brambles bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That pay me not, and only bring me care!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some thoughts had he, long while, to quit the sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sea-port towns to try his luck in trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, then, their ways of living seem'd most odd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dusty streets to leave his native shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From grassy plats to pebbled walks removed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more he thought of them, the less he loved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city springs he could not drink, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preferr'd the fountain near some bushy hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet no splendid objects there were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No distant hills, in gaudy colours clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look where you would, the prospect was but mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scrub oaks, and scatter'd pines, and willows sad&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banks of a shallow river, stain'd with mud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stream, where never swell'd the tide of flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lofty ship her topsails did unlose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sailor sail'd, except in long canoes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It would have puzzled Faustus, to have told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What did attach him to this paltry spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where even the house he heir'd was very old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its outworks hardly worth a groat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet so it was, the fancy took his brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A country shop might here some custom gain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiskey, he knew, would always be in vogue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While there are country squires to take a cogue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laces and lawns would draw each rural maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one must have her shawl, and one her shade.&mdash;<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Shop Described and the<br />
Merchant's Outset</span></h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hard by the road a pigmy building stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thatch'd was its roof, and earthen were its floors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So small its size, that, in a jesting mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be call'd a house turn'd out of doors&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here, adjacent to an aged oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full fifty years old dad his hams did smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ceas'd the trade, 'till worn with years and spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pluto's smoke-house he, himself, was sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hither our merchant turn'd his curious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mused awhile upon this sable shell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Here father smoked his hogs (he said) and why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In truth, may not our garret do as well?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, down he took his hams and bacon flitches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolv'd to fill the place with other riches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every hole and cranny brush'd the soot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixt up shelves throughout the crazy hut;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A counter, too, most cunningly was plann'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind whose breast-work none but he might stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excepting now and then, by special grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some brother merchant from some other place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, muster'd up his cash, and said his prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Sunday suit he rigs himself for town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two raw-boned steeds (design'd for great affairs)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are to the waggon hitch'd, old Bay and Brown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ne'er had been before a league from home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now are doom'd full many a mile to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like merchant-ships, a various freight to bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ribbons, lawns, and many a tawdry thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Molasses too, blest sweet, was not forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And island Rum, that every taste delights,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teas, for maid and matron must be bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rosin and catgut strings for fiddling wights&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why should I his invoice here repeat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould be like counting grains in pecks of wheat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half Europe's goods were on his invoice found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was to be bought with forty pound!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon as the early dawn proclaim'd the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cock'd his hat with pins, and comb'd his hair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curious it was, and laughable to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village-merchant, mounted in his chair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shelves, piled with lawns and linens, in his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coatings and stuffs, and cloths, and scarlets red&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that would suit man, woman, girl, or boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muslins and muslinets, jeans, grograms, corduroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alack! said I, he little, little dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the cash he guards with studious care&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cash! the mother of a thousand schemes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will hardly buy a load of earthen ware!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why should I excite the hidden tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whispering truths ungrateful to his ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still let him travel on, with scheming pate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As disappointment never comes too late.&mdash;<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">His Journey to the Metropolis; and Mercantile<br />
Transactions</span></h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through woods obscure and rough perplexing ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow and alone, he urged the clumsy wheel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now stopping short, to let his horses graze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now treating them with straw and Indian meal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length a lofty steeple caught his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Higher (thought he) than ever kite did fly:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so it is, these churchmen are so proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ever will be climbing to a cloud;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound on a sky-blue cruise, they always rig<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The longest steeple, and the largest wig."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now safe arrived upon the pebbled way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where well-born steeds the rattling coaches trail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shops on shops are seen&mdash;and ladies gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk with their curtains some, and some their veil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sons of art their various labors shew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one cries fish! and one cries muffins ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amaz'd, alike, the merchant, and his pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scare-crow steeds, did nothing else but stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So new was all the scene, that, smit with awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They grinn'd, and gaz'd, and gap'd at all they saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often stopp'd, to ask at every door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sirs, can you tell us where's the cheapest store!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The cheapest store (a sly retailer said)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Cheaper than cheap, guid faith, I have to sell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here are some colour'd cloths that never fade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No other shop can serve you half so well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wanting some money now, to pay my rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll sell them at a loss of ten per cent.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hum-hums are here&mdash;and muslins&mdash;what you please&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bandanas, baftas, pullcats, India teas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Improv'd by age, and now grown very old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And given away, you may depend&mdash;not sold!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lured by the bait the wily shopman laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave his steeds their mess of straw and meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gazing round the shop, thus, cautious said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, if you sell so cheap, I think we'll deal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But pray remember, 'tis for goods I'm come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For, as to polecats, we've enough at home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Full forty pounds I have, and that in gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"(Enough to make a trading man look bold)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Unrig your shelves, and let me take a peep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis odds I leave them bare, you sell so cheap."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The city merchant stood, with lengthen'd jaws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stared awhile, then made this short reply&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"You clear my shelves! (he said)&mdash;this trunk of gauze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is more than all your forty pounds can buy:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"On yonder board, whose burthen seems so small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That one man's pocket might contain it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"More value lies, than you and all your race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From Adam down, could purchase or possess."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Convinced, he turn'd him to another street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where humbler shopmen from the crowd retreat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here caught his eye coarse callicoes and crape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pipes and tobacco, ticklenburghs and tape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitchers and pots, of value not so high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he might sell, and forty pounds would buy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some jugs, some pots, some fifty ells of tape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A keg of wine, a cask of low proof rum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bung'd close&mdash;for fear the spirit should escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That many a sot was waiting for at home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gross of pipes, a case of home-made gin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tea, powder, shot&mdash;small parcels he laid in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Molasses, too, for swichell<a name="FNanchor_C_33" id="FNanchor_C_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_33" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>-loving wights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Swichell, that wings Sangrado's boldest flights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When bursting forth the wild ideas roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd from that farthing-candle, call'd his soul:)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these he bought, and would have purchased more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To furnish out his Lilliputian store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cash fell short&mdash;and they who smiled while yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cash remain'd, now took a serious fit:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the shop-girl could his talk endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, like her cat, sat sullen and demure.&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dull retailer found no more to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shook his head, and wish'd to sneak away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving his house-dog, now, to make reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watch the counter with a lynx's eye.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our merchant took the hint, and off he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolv'd to sell at twenty-five per cent.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Returning far o'er many a hill and stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much in dread his earthen ware would break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful he rode, and uttering many a groan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest at some worm-hole vent his cask should leak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cask, that held the joys of rural squire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which even, 'twas said, the parson did admire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And valued more than all the dusty pages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Calvin penn'd, and fifty other sages&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Five gallons might have mellowed down the 'squire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And made the captain strut a full inch higher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Five gallons might have prompted many a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And made a frolic more than five days long:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Five gallons now are lost, and&mdash;sad to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That when they leak'd&mdash;no soul was there to drink!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, slightly treated with a proof-glass dram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each neighbour took his leave, and went to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but our merchant: he, with grief o'ercome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolv'd strange notions in his scheming head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For losses such as these, (thought he) 'tis meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That goods are sold at twenty-five per cent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No doubt these trading men know what is just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis twenty-five times what they cost at first!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So rigging off his shelves by light of candle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dismal smoke-house walls began to shine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, stood his tea-pots&mdash;some without a handle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A broken jar&mdash;and there his keg of wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pipes, many a dozen, ordered in a row;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jugs, mugs, and grog-bowls&mdash;less for sale than show:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaky cask, replenish'd from the well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll'd to its birth&mdash;but we no tales will tell.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Catching the eye in elegant display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was arranged and snug, by break of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue dram-bottle, on the counter plac'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, all prepared for him that buys to taste;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure bait! by which the man of cash is taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As rats are caught by cheese or scraps of bacon.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now from all parts the rural people ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ready cash, to buy what might be bought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One went to choose a pot, and one a pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they that had no pence their produce brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hog, a calf, safe halter'd by the neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Potatoes (Ireland's glory) many a peck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bacon and cheese, of real value more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than India's gems, or all Potosi's ore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some questions ask'd, the folks began to stare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No soul would purchase, pipe, or pot, or pan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each shook his  head&mdash;hung back&mdash;"Your goods so dear!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In fact (said they) the devil's in the man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rum ne'er shall meet my lips (cry'd honest Sam)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In shape of toddy, punch, grog, sling, or dram;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No cash of mine you'll get (said pouting Kate)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"While gauze is valued at so dear a rate."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus things dragg'd on for many a tedious day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No custom came; and nought but discontent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloom'd through the shop.&mdash;"Well, let them have their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The merchant said) I'll sell at cent per cent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"By which, 'tis plain, I scarce myself can save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For cent per cent is just the price I gave."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Now! (cry'd the squire who still had kept his pence)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, Sir, you reason like a man of sense!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Custom will now from every quarter come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In joyous streams shall flow the inspiring rum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Till every soul in pleasing dreams be sunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And even our Socrates himself&mdash;is drunk!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon were the shelves disburthen'd of their load;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In three short hours the kegs of wine ran dry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift from its tap even dull molasses flow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each saw the rum cask wasting, with a sigh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farce concluded, as it was foreseen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With empty shelves&mdash;long trust&mdash;and law suits keen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woods resounding with a curse on trade,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An empty purse&mdash;sour looks&mdash;and hanging head.&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Phaon, the admirer of Sappho, both of the isle of Lesbos, privately forsook
this first object of his affections, and set out to visit foreign countries.
Sappho, after having long mourned his absence (which is the subject of one of
Ovid's finest epistles), is here supposed to fall into the company of Ismenius a
traveller, who informs her that he saw the tomb of a certain Phaon in Sicily,
erected to his memory by a lady of the island, and gives her the inscriptions,
hinting to her that, in all probability, it belonged to the same person she
bemoans. She thereupon, in a fit of rage and despair, throws herself from the
famous Leucadian rock, and perishes in the gulph below.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_40" id="Footnote_36_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_40"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The first trace that I can find of this poem is in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>
of May 18, 1785. I have little doubt that it is the "Stanzas on an Ancient
Dutch House on Long Island," mentioned in 1773 in a letter to Madison as
forming a part of Freneau's publication, "<i>The American Village</i>," now lost.
After its appearance in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, it was widely copied. The
<i>Independent Gazetteer</i> printed it in 1787, introduced as follows: "The following
is copied from Perryman's <i>London Morning Herald</i> of July 22, 1787: 'The
Deserted Farm House,' written in America by Mr. Freneau, whose political
productions tended considerably to keep alive the spirit of independence during
the late civil war." I have followed the text of 1809. The poet constantly
emended this poem; he seldom reprinted it without minor changes, usually for
the better.</p></div>

graduating address of Freneau and Brackenridge at Princeton, Brackenridge
delivering it, was first published In 1772 at Philadelphia, by Joseph Crukshank,
for R. Aitken, bookseller. This pamphlet edition is the only one
extant of the original poem. Freneau reprinted his own part, with many
modifications and additions, in the first edition of his poems, 1786, explaining
it with the following note: "This poem is a little altered from the original
(published in Philadelphia in 1772), such parts being only inserted here as
were written by the author of this volume. A few more modern lines towards
the conclusion are incorporated with the rest, being a supposed prophetical
anticipation of subsequent events." The text of the edition of 1772, which is
now exceedingly rare, is as follows:</p>

<h3>A POEM ON THE RISING GLORY OF AMERICA</h3>

<p class="center">Being an Exercise delivered at the Public Commencement at Nassau-Hall,
September 25, 1771.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Argument</span></h4>

<p class="nblockquot">The subject proposed.&mdash;The discovery of America by Columbus and others.&mdash;A
philosophical enquiry into the origin of the savages of America.&mdash;Their
uncultivated state.&mdash;The first planters of America.&mdash;The cause of
their migration from Europe.&mdash;The difficulties they encountered from
the resentment of the natives and other circumstances.&mdash;The French war
in North America.&mdash;The most distinguished heroes who fell in it; Wolf,
Braddock, &amp;c.&mdash;General Johnson,&mdash;his character.&mdash;North America,
why superior to South.&mdash;On Agriculture.&mdash;On commerce.&mdash;On science.&mdash;Whitefield,&mdash;his
character.&mdash;The present glory of America.&mdash;A prospect
of its future glory, in science,&mdash;in liberty,&mdash;and the gospel.&mdash;The conclusion
of the whole.</p>

<p>The 1786 edition, which was evolved with such great changes from the
original version, furnished the text of the 1795 edition. There were some
twenty variations and three added lines, viz., lines 354, 427, 438. Line 265
was changed from "Which full enjoyment only finds for fools," to its final
form; line 352 was changed from "A thousand kingdoms rais'd;" line 360,
from "Our Alexanders, Pompeys, heroes, kings;" line 371, from "One
monarchy;" and 461, from "Death's ancient." The other changes were
largely verbal, nearly all being  for the better. For the edition of 1809,
Freneau used the 1795 text, with some twenty-one variations and one added
line, viz., line 67. These variations, which nearly all concern single words,
are generally not at all for the better: for instance, "Shackle," in line 343, is
changed to "people;" "our sons," in line 365, is changed to "a race;"
"were born," in 367, to "we exist;" and "strumpets," in 409, to "vagrants."
Freneau's notes in the various editions were as follows:</p>

<span class="i0">And where the wintry suns expend their fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What land to land protracts the varied scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what extended oceans roll between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What worlds exist beneath antarctic skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from Pacific waves what verdant islands rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In vain did Nature shore from shore divide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art formed a passage and her waves defied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his bold plan the master pilot drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissevered worlds stept forward at the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lessening still the intervening space,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Proud even of toil, succeeding ages joined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New seas to vanquish, and new worlds to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Age following age still farther from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found some new wonder that was hid before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till launched at length, with avarice doubly bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts expanding as the world grew old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some to be rich, and some to be renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth they rifled, and explored it round.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thine was the art that toil to toil allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine was the gift, to trace each heavenly sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seize its beams, to serve ambition here:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, fierce Pizarro stock'd a world with graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence Montezuma left a race of slaves.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which project suited best with heaven's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force new doctrines, or to leave them free?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion only feigned to claim a share,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How few have sailed on virtue's nobler plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How few with motives worthy of a man!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Met on the wrecks and ravages of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They left no native master of his clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trees, his towns, with hardened front they claimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized every region that a despot named<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced the oath that bound him to obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some prince unknown, ten thousand miles away.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Slaves to their passions, man's imperious race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born for contention, find no resting place,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To their vain standard Europe's sons invite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hold no other world can think aright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold their varied tribes, with self applause,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And while they bow to cruelty and blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemn the Indian with his milder god.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, race to justice, truth, and honour blind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Vain pride&mdash;convince them that your own are just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or leave them happy, as you found them first.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What charm is seen through Europe's realms of strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That adds new blessings to the savage life?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On them warm suns with equal splendor shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their each domestic pleasure equals thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their native groves as soft a bloom display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As self-contented roll their lives away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gay soul, in fancy's visions blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves to the care of chance her heaven of rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What are the arts that rise on Europe's plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But arts destructive to the bliss of man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are all wars, where'er the marks you trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sad records of our world's disgrace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reason degraded from her tottering throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And precepts, called divine, observed by none.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blest in their distance from that bloody scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why spread the sail to pass the gulphs between?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If winds can waft to ocean's utmost verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there new islands and new worlds emerge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If wealth, or war, or science bid thee roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, leave religion and thy laws at home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the free native to enjoy his store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor teach destructive arts, unknown before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woes of their own those new found worlds invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, too, fierce passions the weak soul degrade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invention there has winged the unerring dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the swift arrow vibrates to the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenge and death contending bosoms share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pining envy claims her subjects there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these too few?&mdash;then see despotic power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spends on a throne of logs her busy hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by, and half ambitious to ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priests, interceding with the gods, attend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atoning victims at their shrines they lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their crimson knives tremendous rites display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the proud despot's gore remorseless shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through life detested, or adored when dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Born to be wretched, search this globe around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dupes to a few the race of man is found!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek some new world in some new climate plac'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some gay Ta-ia<a name="FNanchor_H_54" id="FNanchor_H_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_54" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> on the watery waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Nature clothes in all her bright array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some proud tormentor steals her charms away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howe'er she smiles beneath those milder skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though men decay the monarch never dies!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">My morning of life is beclouded with care!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will go to Passaick, I say and I swear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the falls of Passaick, that elegant scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all is so pretty, and all is so green&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That river Passaick!&mdash;celestial indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That river of rivers, no rivers exceed.&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now why, I would ask, should I puzzle my brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of stars, or their use to explain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trace the effects they may have on our earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How govern our actions, or rule at our birth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five years have I been at these studies, and scanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the books on the subject that sophists have planned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sorry to say (yet it ought to be said)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars have not sent me one rye loaf of bread!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a shilling to purchase a glass of good beer,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By my soul, it's enough to make ministers swear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tryphena may argue, and say what she will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sure all my fortune is going down hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear girl! if you wait 'till the planets are for us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your name will scarce alter to Tryphena Taurus.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tryphena! I love you&mdash;have courted you long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But find all my labours will end in a song!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Will you play at all-fours?"&mdash;she said, very jolly;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I answered, The play at all-fours is all folly!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Will you play, then, at whist?"&mdash;she obligingly said;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I answered, the game is gone out of my head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed, I am weary&mdash;I feel rather sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, I leave you, Tryphena, to win the odd trick.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There's a music some talk of, that's play'd by the spheres:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish him all luck who this harmony hears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the people who hear it, I hope they may find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not a music that fills them with wind.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's Saturn, and Venus, and Jove, and the rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their music to me is not quite of the best.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">These orbs of the stars, and that globe of the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, I am certain, all play a wrong tune.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a creature that plods in, or ploughs up the dirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the mean clod gets a better support:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then farewell to Mars, and the rest of the gang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the comets&mdash;I tell them they all may go hang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean, if they only with music will treat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not to me the best cooked of all meat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They may go where they will, and return when they please,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I hope they'll remember to pay up my fees&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I leave them awhile, to be cheerful below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away to Passaick most merrily go!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The month, it was August, and meltingly warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a cloud in the sky nor the sign of a storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I jumped in the stage, with the freight of the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in less than a day at Passaick we were.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Well, arrived at the Falls, I procured me a bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a box of a house&mdash;you might call it a shed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of the taverns were all pre-engaged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I barely was lodged, or rather encaged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, cage as it was, I enjoyed a regale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of victuals three times every day, without fail:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was poultry, and pyes, and a dozen things more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the damnable college had never in store:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feasted, and lived on such fat of the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the college would not have remembered my face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long had I fed on their trash algebraic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed, it was time I went to Passaick!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The rocks were amazing, and such was the height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They struck me at once with surprize and delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The waters rushed down with a terrible roar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a pleasure it was to be lounging on shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They now were as clear as old Helicon's stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as clear as the clearest in poetry's dream.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These falls were stupendous, the fountains so clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That another Narcissus might see himself here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor only Narcissus&mdash;some ill-featured faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the springs were reflected&mdash;not made up of graces.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But now I must tell you&mdash;what people were met:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were, on my conscience, a wonderful sett;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some came for their health, and some came for their pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to steal from the city a fortnight of leisure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some came for a day, and yet more for a week,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some came from the college, tormented with Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To continue as long as their means would afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is, while the taverns would trust them their board:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Of this last mentioned class, I confess I was one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For why should I fib when the mischief is done?)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This age may decay, and another may rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before it is fully revealed to our eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Latin, and Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the shades of oblivion must certainly sneak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much of our time is employed on such trash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we ought to be taught to accumulate cash.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supposing I knew them as pat as my prayers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And to know them completely would cost me twelve years)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supposing, I say, I had Virgil by rote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could talk with old Homer&mdash;'tis not worth a groat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If with Rabbi Bensalem I knew how to chat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lies the advantage?&mdash;and what of all that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were this cart load of learning the whole that I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could sooner get forward by mending a shoe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could sooner grow rich by the axe or the spade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thrive by the meanest mechanical trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tinker himself would be richer than I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the tinker has something that people must buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While such as have little but Latin to vend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a shadow may truly be said to depend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old words, and old phrases that nothing bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the owners discarded ten ages ago.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here were people on people&mdash;I hardly know who&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was Mammon the merchant, and Japhet the Jew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was Slyboots the Quaker, whose coat had no flaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two of his Lambkins, as plain in their caps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silks of the richest I saw them array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing was cut in our mode of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hung to old habits as firm as to rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are just what they were in the days of George Fox.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They talked in a style that was wholly their own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shunned the vain world, and were mostly alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One talked in the Nay, and one talked in the Yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of light in their lanthorns that no one could see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hated the crowd, and they hated the play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoped the vain actors would soon run away;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No follies like that would the preachers allow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tabitha said thee, and Rebecca said thou.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span><span class="i1">Here was Dullman, the broker, who looked as demure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a false key had unlocked the shop door:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed to enjoy not a moment of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So unhappy to be&mdash;far away from his chest.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He was all on the fidgets to be with his gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both honour and conscience he bartered, or sold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The devil himself&mdash;excuse me, I pray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Satan&mdash;oh no&mdash;take it some other way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God of this world had him fast by a chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there let us leave him&mdash;and let him remain.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here was Samuel, the Deacon, who read a large book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though few but himself on its pages would look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would you know what it was?&mdash;an abridgement of Flavell,<a name="FNanchor_U_79" id="FNanchor_U_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_79" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Bunyan's whole war between soul and the devil;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed very old, and the worse for the wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And might last the next century, handled with care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if fashions and folly should not have a fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I presume it will hardly be handled at all.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here was Nimrod the soldier&mdash;he wore a long sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, of course, all the ladies his courage adored;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two fringed epaulettes on his shoulders displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discovered the rank of this son of the blade.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"O la!" cried Miss Kitty, "how bold he must be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Papa! we must beg him to join us at tea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much like a hero he looketh&mdash;good me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a battle, no doubt, he has stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waded shoe deep through a mill pond of mud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heads have been sliced from the place they possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sword at his side!&mdash;all, I hope, for the best!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><span class="i1">Then the soldier went out, to refresh at the inn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps he did not&mdash;if he did it's no sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made his congee, and he bowed to us all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said he was going to Liberty Hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis certain he went, but certainly where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot inform, and the devil may care.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But now to proceed, in describing in rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The folks that came hither to pass away time:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were more that had heads rather shallow than strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than had money to bear them out long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, there were many more ladies than gents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the latter complained of the heavy expense!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some I could see, with their splendour and show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That their credit was bad, and their pockets were low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many females were gadding, I saw with concern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had better been knitting, or weaving their yarn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many went into Passaick to lave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hides were, indeed, a disgrace to the wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who should have been home at their houses and farms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not here to be dabbling, to shew us their charms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would have been better to wash their own walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than here&mdash;to come here, to be washed in the falls.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A judge of the court (in the law a mere goose)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here wasted his time with a lawyer let loose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their books were thrown by&mdash;so I begged of the fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the falls of Passaick might fall on their pates.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This lawyer was Ludwick, who scarce had a suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for once in his life was disposed to be mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But was mostly engaged in some crazy dispute:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cause against Smyth<a name="FNanchor_V_80" id="FNanchor_V_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_80" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> he could never defend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well might the Old One with Michael contend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The road was before him, the country was spacious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew an old fellow called <i>fieri facias</i>:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him demurr, when they asked him to pay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a <i>noli-pros-equi</i> he scampered away.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his head was profusely be-plaistered with meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sorrowful secret it could not conceal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he drew his first breath when a two penny star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presided, and governed this son of the bar.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here was Pedro, the parson, who looked full as grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it he had lodged in Trophonius's cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He talked of his wine, and he talked of his beer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he talked of his texts, that were not very clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many suspected he talked very queer.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He talked with Scalpella, the inn-holder's wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dwelt on her beauties, and called her his life!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ogled Scalpella!&mdash;and spake of her charms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh! how he wished to repose in her arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called her his deary, and talked of their loves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left her at last&mdash;a pair of old gloves!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I was sorry to see him deranged and perplext<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no one would ask him to handle a text:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All gaped when he spoke, and incessantly gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought him no witch, but a parson be-crazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fine work did he make of Millennium, I trow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he told us would come (tho' it comes very slow)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When earth with the pious and just will abound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Eden itself at Egg-Harbour be found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No musketoes to bite us, no rats to molest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lawyers themselves rocked into something like rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But most of us judged it was rather a whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, at least, that the prospect was distant and dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I saw him pack up his polemical gown,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><span class="i0">To retreat while he could from the noise of the town.<a name="FNanchor_W_81" id="FNanchor_W_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_81" class="fnanchor">[C]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said there was something in Falls he admired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of constantly hearing the roar&mdash;he was tired!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their damp exhalations his fancy was dimmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would come the next spring with his surplice new trimmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides there were fogs in the morning (he said)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rose on the river and muddled his head!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he quitted Passaick!&mdash;deserted her shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the taverns that knew him shall know him no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One farmer Milhollan&mdash;I saw him come here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost at the busiest time in the year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His intent might be good, but I never could learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who coaxed him away from his crib and his barn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each morning he tippled three glasses of gin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With as many, at least, as three devils therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He quarrelled with Jack, and he wrangled with Tom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till scarcely a negro but wished him at home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He talked over much of the badness of times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read us a list of the governor's<a name="FNanchor_X_82" id="FNanchor_X_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_82" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which it was clearly predicted, and plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his honour would hardly be chosen again.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He fought with Tim Tearcoat, and cudgelled with Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrestled with Sampson&mdash;all quarrelsome men;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was sorry to see him thus wasting his force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fellows who kicked with the heels of a horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' strong in my arms, and of strength to contest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the youths of my age in the wars of the fist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought it was better to let them pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quarrels they had, than to be one of their crew;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw it was madness to join in the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I left them to wrangle&mdash;each dog his own way.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He spoke thrice an hour of his crop that had failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And losses, he feared, that would get him enjailed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mentioned his poultry, and mentioned his pigs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And railed at some Tories, converted to Whigs.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(Excuse me retailing so much in my rhymes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the chatt of the day and the stuff of the times;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis thus in the acts of a play, we perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the parts are not cast to the wise, or the brave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all is discoursed by the famed or the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The demons of dullness have also their share;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Statira in play-house has not all the chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hags are permitted to join in the dance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Catos, or Platos engross every play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For clowns and clod-hoppers must, too, have their day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the nobles of nature say all that is said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And monarchs are frequently left in the shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There must be some nonsense, to step in between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There must be some fools to enliven the scene.)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here was Doctor Sangrado, with potion and pill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his price was the same, to recover or kill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waddled about, and was vext to the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see so much health in this horrible hole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed in a fret there was nobody sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enquired of the landlord, "What ails your son Dick?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What ails him? (said Gubbins) why nothing at all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"By my soul (said the quack) he's as white as the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must give him a potion to keep down his gall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is bile on his stomach&mdash;I clearly see that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This night he will vomit as black as my hat:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><span class="i0">Here's a puke and a purge&mdash;twelve doses of bark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him swallow them all&mdash;just an hour before dark!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"O dear! (said the mother) the lad is quite well!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the Doctor, "No, no! he must take calomel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will put him to rights, as I hope to be saved!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Or rather (said Gubbins) you hope him engraved!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So, the Doctor walked off in a pitiful plight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he lodged in a dog-house (they told me) that night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here were wives, and young widows, and matrons, and maids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who came for their health, or to stroll in the shades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here were Nellies, and Nancies, and Hetties, by dozens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their neighbours, and nephews, and nieces, and cousins&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these had come hither to see the famed Fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, pretty Sally, the best of them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here was Saunders, the jockey, who rode a white horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His last, it was said, and his only resource;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the landlord was careful to put us in mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hell and destruction were riding behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He often had told him, "Do, Saunders, take care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This swilling of gin is a cursed affair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed&mdash;and it puts a man off from his legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brings us at last to be pelted with eggs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wit of your noddle should carry you through,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break your bottle of rum&mdash;give the devil his due!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep the reason about you that nature designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you have the respect and regard of mankind!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This steed of poor Saunders' was woefully lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked, as we thought, like the flying machine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in short, it appeared, by the looks of his hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the stables he came from were poorly supplied:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span><span class="i0">A bundle of bones&mdash;and they whispered it round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he came from the hole where the Mammoth was found.<a name="FNanchor_Y_83" id="FNanchor_Y_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_83" class="fnanchor">[E]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i1">They stuff'd him with hay, and they crammed him with oats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Saunders was gaming and drinking with sots:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For the de'il in the shape of a bottle of rum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceived him with visions of fortune to come;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His landlady had on the horse a sheep's-eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Saunders had plenty of whiskey and pye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had gin of the best, and he treated all round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till care was dismissed and solicitude drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a reckoning was brought him of more than three pound.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As he had not a groat in his lank looking purse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landlord made seizure of saddle and horse:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scalpella, the hostess, cried, "Fly from this room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I'll sweep you away with my hickory broom!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thus Saunders sneaked off in a sorrowful way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Falls were his fall&mdash;to be beggar next day.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The lady of ladies that governed the inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a sharper indeed, and she kept such a din!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scalpella!&mdash;and may I remember the name!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could scratch like a tyger, or play a tight game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bludgeon she constantly held in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sign of respect, and a sign of command:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could scream like a vulture, or wink like an owl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a dog in the street like Scalpella could howl.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a Scalpella!&mdash;I am yet on her books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! may I never encounter her looks!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I owe her five pounds&mdash;I am that in her debt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my dues from the stars have not cleared it off yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she knew where I am!&mdash;I should fare very ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of some beer she would drench me with swill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should curse and reflect on the hour I was born.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she thought I had fixed on the pitch of Cape Horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would find me!&mdash;Scalpella! set down what I owe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the page of bad debts&mdash;due to Scalpy and Co!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her boarders she hated, and drove with a dash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing about them she liked but their cash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except they were Tories&mdash;ah, then she was kind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said to their honours, "You are men to my mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit down, my dear creatures&mdash;I hope you've not dined!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She talked of the king, and she talked of the queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she talked of her floors&mdash;that were not very clean:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She talked of the parson, and spoke of the 'squire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She talked of her child that was singed in the fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tories, poor beings, were wishing to kiss her&mdash;oh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they had&mdash;all the stars would have fought against&mdash;Cicero.<a name="FNanchor_Z_84" id="FNanchor_Z_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_84" class="fnanchor">[F]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She talked, and she talked&mdash;now angry, now civil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till the  Tories themselves wished her gone to the devil.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How I tremble to think of her tongue and her stick,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tryphena, Tryphena! I've played the odd trick!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now the soldier re-entered&mdash;the ladies were struck:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "she that can win him will have the best luck!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"La! father (said Kitty) observe the bold man!<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_78" id="Footnote_58_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_78"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Freneau mentions in this poem that it was printed in New York in September,
1775. I can find no trace of it, either as a separate publication or
a contribution to a newspaper. As far as I can find, the poem is unique in the
edition of 1809.
</p><p>
Mr. William Nelson of Paterson, N. J., Secretary of the New Jersey
Historical Society, believes that the local allusions in the poem cannot be
verified. He writes:
</p><p>
"There were but two taverns at the Passaic Falls at that time; one kept
by Abraham Godwin, the other by James Leslie. Godwin and three of his
sons went in the American Army at the beginning of the Revolution, and he
died in the service. His widow survived him and carried on the tavern for a
number of years. She had an intolerant hatred of all Tories. In 1776 Leslie
was keeping a tavern at the present Passaic, a few miles below the Passaic
Falls, and he continued there during the greater part of the Revolution, I
think.
</p><p>
"The character of the tavern-keeper's wife, 'Scalpella,' is either purely
fictitious or based on the character of some other person. Moreover, I do not
think Passaic Falls was ever a summer resort of the character depicted in this
poem. Travellers merely went there to see the Falls, occasionally staying over
night, but I cannot think it possible that there could have been such a party
assembled there at one time as indicated in the poem. I do not think the two
taverns together could have accommodated so many people. The place was
never called 'Passaic Village,' as stated in the note, but was known as Totown
Bridge until 1792, when Paterson was founded. Passaic Village was the name
given about forty years ago to the present city of Passaic.
</p><p>
"The only allusions in the poem which have some semblance of reality are
the references to 'Miss Kitty,' by whom is perhaps meant the daughter of
Lord Stirling; and 'Liberty Hall,' the residence of her uncle, Gov. Livingstone,
near Elizabethtown. There was no such person as 'Gubbins.' I
should think that the scene of the poem, if it has any foundation whatever in
fact, was more probably laid somewhere near Philadelphia."</p></div>

him since the year of his graduation at Princeton, and enters upon an
era of marvelous productiveness. For four months, poetry must have been
his one thought, his one occupation. It was during this period of his life that
he did his most spontaneous and original work.</p></div>

Freneau, where it is dated "New York, Sept. 26, 1775." In this edition,
and in that of 1795, it had the title "Libera Nos, Domine." In the edition
of 1809, which I have followed, it is dated "<i>New-York, June, 1775.</i>" The
earlier date is probably the date of publication.</p></div>

war, did much to exasperate the colonists. "He stopped and searched vessels
without adequate pretext, and fired at the market boats as they entered Newport
harbor. He treated the farmers on the islands much as the Saracens in
the Middle Ages treated the coast population of Italy." He was mild in
appearance, but testy and arbitrary to an extraordinary degree. He covered
the British retreat from Boston, aided Lord Dunmore to escape from Virginia,
and took part in the capture of New York City.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69_98" id="Footnote_69_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_98"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Of the siege of Havana, in July, 1762, Bancroft writes: "This siege
was conducted in midsummer, against a city which lies just within the tropic.
The country around the Moro Castle is rocky. To bind and carry the fascines
was of itself a work of incredible labor;... sufficient earth to hold the fascines
firm was gathered with difficulty from the crevices of the rocks. Once, after a
drought of fourteen days, the grand battery took fire from the flames, and
crackling and spreading where water could not follow it, nor earth stifle it, was
wholly consumed. The climate spoiled a great part of the provisions. Wanting
good water, many died in agonies of thirst. More fell victims of a putrid
fever.... Hundreds of carcasses floated on the ocean. And yet such was the
enthusiasm of the English, such the resolute zeal of the sailors and soldiers,
such the unity of action between the fleet and army, that the vertical sun of
June and July, the heavy rains of August, raging fever, and strong and well
defended fortresses, all the obstacles of nature and art were surmounted, and
the most decisive victory of the war was gained."</p></div>

lines, was first published in New York, by H. Gaine, in August, 1775. The
poem was thus written and published in the early days of the siege.
</p><p>
General Gage, the last royal governor of Massachusetts, arrived in Boston
May, 1774, and remained until October, 1775, when he was succeeded by Major
General Howe. The siege of Boston began with the arrival of Washington
before the city, early in July, 1775, and continued until Howe was forced to
evacuate the city, the following March. Gage's incompetency was admitted
even by his own countrymen. He was narrow-minded, and prejudiced, and
unable to estimate justly the forces that were against him. His only argument
was force and dictatorial interference.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_85_116" id="Footnote_85_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_116"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> Text from the edition of 1809. The poem was first published in New
York in 1775 by Anderson, under the title, "A Voyage to Boston, a poem,"
and a second edition was printed the same year in Philadelphia for William
Woodhouse. The revision of the poem in the 1786 edition of Freneau's works
mentions that the poem was published in September, 1775. This is evidently
a mistake. In the issue of October 21, of Anderson's <i>Constitutional Gazette,</i>
appears the advertisement, "This day is published &amp; to be sold by the printer,
'A Voyage to Boston: a Poem.'" The copy of the poem in possession of the
Library Company, Philadelphia, has endorsed upon it, "published in October,
1775." This earliest version, only a fragment of which was given in the various
editions of the poet's works, has never before been reprinted. It is as
follows:
</p>
<h3>A VOYAGE TO BOSTON, A POEM</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Argument</span></h4>
<p  class="nblockquot">Introductory reflections. A traveller undertakes a voyage to Boston: arrives
in a river of Massachusetts: has there a sight of the native Genius of
North-America, who presents him with a mantle, and acquaints him with
its virtue of rendering the wearer invisible; desires him to visit the town
in that state and remark the transactions there. Accordingly he arrives
at General Gage's mansion, where are several other ministerial tools
sitting in council. The striking similarity of Gage's temper and conduct
to that of Hernando Cortez. Some account of Cortez, and his horrid
devastations in Mexico, &amp;c. The traveller enters their junto, and gives
an account of the chief members of it, viz., General Gage, Admiral
Greaves, General Burgoyne, Lord Percy, General Howe, Capt. Wallace,
and a numerous fry of dependents and needy favourites waiting for posts
and estates in America, as soon as they shall have compelled us to
resign our liberties: General Gage's surprize at their several defeats in
New-England, and questions his leaders thereupon. Lord Percy's
answer: Greaves's reply to that nobleman: Gage's raillery upon Percy
for his nimble retreat on April 19, 1775. Percy's defence of his conduct
on that day, and the reason of his activity; and desires them to forget
Lexington for the present, and turn their eyes to the late loss at Bunker's
Hill. General Howe's speech concerning that action. Burgoyne's harrangue,
with his invectives against Colonel Grant, who "pledged himself
for the general cowardice of all America:" Gage's brief reply; and communicates
his intention of purloining cattle from the islands, and plans
that right honourable exploit; but being overcome by sleep, dismisses his
counsellors. The cutting down the Liberty Tree in Boston, and untimely
end of one of the wretches employed in that sneaking affair. Distresses
of the imprisoned citizens in Boston. Dissection of a Tory. The traveller
leaves Boston, and visits the Provincial Camp; meets the Genius of
America again on the way and resigns the mantle, whereby he again
becomes visible; arrives at the camp. View of the Rifle-men, Virginians,
&amp;c. Speech of an American soldier; his determined resolution,
which is that of all America, to defend our rights and privileges. Grief
that he must fight against our own nation. Mention of Carleton and
Johnson; concludes with a melancholy recital of our present distractions,
and sincere hope of reconcilation with Great Britain before a
wicked ministry render it too late. Conclusion.</p>

<span class="i1">How curs'd the man whom fate's unhappy doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confines, unluckly, to his native home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How doubly curs'd by cross grain'd stars is he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom fate ties down, tho' struggling to be free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven gave to man this vast extended round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No climes confine him and no oceans bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven gave him forest, mountain, vale and plain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, miser, hoard and heap thy riches still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">View the sun rise above thy well known hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vile as the swine, enjoy thy gloomy den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweat in the compass of a squalid pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till sick of life, on terms with death agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave thy fortune, not thy heart, to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So mus'd the bard who this rough verse indites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asserting freedom, and his country's rights:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mus'd in vain; the fruitful musings brought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And gave desire, a keen desire, to roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred or two hundred leagues from home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where should he go? The eastern hills reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, pensive traveller, with thy tearful eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, and fair Boston from our summit see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No city sits so widow-like as she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her trading navies spread their sails no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remotest nations cease to seek her shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep are her weeds&mdash;in darkest sable clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O come and view the Queen of all that's sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long are her nights, that yield no chearful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like endless nights in tombs below the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low burns her lamp before th' insulting rout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, the lamp dies, and every light goes out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Britain come, and, if you can, relent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This rage, that better might on Spain be spent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Touch'd with the mountain's melancholy prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Perhaps a mountain or Dame Fancy there)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could I refuse, since mutual grief endears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek New Albion's Lady all in tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But doubts perplexing hover'd o'er my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to chuse the aid of horse or wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That suits the best with bards of place and state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This must be needy Rhymers compensate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Jove his ancient bounty has deny'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grants no modern Pegasus to ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dark was the night, the winds tempestuous roar'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From western skies, and warn'd us all aboard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread were the sails, the nimble vessel flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Neptune's bosom and reflected skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor halt I here to tell you how she roves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Tython's chambers and his coral groves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let some prose wand'rer long-sun journals keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I haste me, like the vessel, o'er the deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tire you with descriptions of the coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New mountains gain'd or hills in &aelig;ther lost,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muse can only hint at scenes like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not stop to spend her poem in their praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days we cut the brine with steady prore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth beheld as on New Albion's shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guard me, ye heavens, shield this defenceless head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While travelling o'er these sanguine plains of dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor only me, may heaven defend us all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the harsh rigour of King George's ball.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Far in the depth of an aspiring wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where roll'd its waves a silver winding flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our weary vessel urg'd its darksome way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And safely anchor'd in a shady bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Landing, I left the weather-beaten crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pensive rov'd as home-sick travellers do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all at once before my wand'ring eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Genius of the river seem'd to rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall and erect, untaught by years to bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a smile relax'd his clouded brow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His swarthy features vengeful deeds forebode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror march'd on before him as he trode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rattling quiver at his shoulder hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pointed spear and glitt'ring helmet rung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall oaks trembled at the warlike shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus the Genius of the water said:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O curious stranger, come from far to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What grieves us all, but none so much as me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The free-born Genius of the woods am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who scorn to dwell in lands of slavery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, tho' unseen, command the heart to dare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread the soul of freedom thro' the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each may taste and value if he can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sovereign good that constitutes the man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, in the center of tyrannic sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spread my spirit and forbid dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every bosom dart may influence round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun beams that fructify the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But waft a timorous and ignoble breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where conscience, conscience bids them shrink at death.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O stranger, led by Heaven's supreme decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, view the dire effects of tyranny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strait to the town direct thy fated way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But heark attentive, listen and obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to thy care commit this magic vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guard thee 'midst yon' spires, a viewless guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er its wreathy folds thy limbs embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mortal eye thy roving step shall trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen as ghosts that quit the clay below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet seeing all securely thou shalt go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There watch the motions of the hostile lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observe their counsels, watch their deep designs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trace all their schemes, the lawless strength survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of licens'd robbers howling for their prey."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So spoke the Genius of the shaded wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the vest of wondrous virtue gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which scarce my limbs enwrapt, when I began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To move as ne'er before did mortal man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light as the air, as free as winds I stray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierc'd firmest rocks and walls for prisons made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soar'd high, nor ask'd the feeble aid of art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trac'd all secrets but the human heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the town I held my hasty course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Boston's town subdu'd by lawless force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by a centinel I took my stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch ne'er saw me tho' I graz'd his side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for my vest, what pains had been my lot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gibes, what sneers, reproaches, and what not?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in their place the robbers had constrained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn a Tory, which my heart disdained.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To murder, rage, and ravage o'er our land;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He wants his courage and he wants his sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en Cortez would our tyrant's part disdain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That murder'd strangers; this his countrymen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the rest resemblance so exact,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No glass Venetian could more true reflect.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What power shall drive this serpent from our shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This scorpion, swoln with carnage, death, and gore?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Long sacred held to darling Liberty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its branching arms with verdant leaves were crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imparting shade and grateful coolness round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its fam'd trunk, invisible as air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I from the sleepy council did repair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at its root, fair Freedom's shrine, I paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My warmest vows, and blest the virtuous shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now shin'd the gay fac'd sun with morning light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Nature joy'd exulting at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When swift as wind, to vent their base-born rage,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each, axe in hand, attack'd the honour'd tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swearing eternal war with Liberty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ceas'd their strokes, 'till each repeated wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumbled its honours headlong to the ground;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A Tory soldier on its topmost limb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Genius of the shade look'd stern at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mark'd him out that self same hour to dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where unsnuff'd lamps burn low at Pluto's shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then tripp'd his feet from off their cautious stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale turn'd the wretch&mdash;he spread each helpless hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spread in vain, with headlong force he fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stopp'd descending 'till he stopp'd in Hell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Next, curious to explore, I wander'd where<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some in dark dungeons held ignobly down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gage holds them there, and all recess denies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'tis in these the coward's safety lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were these once out, how would our troops consign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each licens'd robber to the gulphy brine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drive them foaming to the ships for aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beg of stormy Greaves to cannonade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And midnight vengeance point, like Vandeput,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voiding his hell-hounds to their devilish glut.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A deed like that the muse must blush to name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids me stamp a coward on thy fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rage, ruffian, rage, nor lay thy thunder down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till all our Tories howl and flee the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What is a Tory? Heavens and earth reveal!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What strange blind monster does that name conceal?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come lay his heart and inmost entrails bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, by the forelock, seize the Stygian hound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You bind his arms and bind the dragon down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surgeon, attend with thy dissecting knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aim well the stroke that damps the springs of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extract his fangs, dislodge his teeth of prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clap in your pincers, and then tear away.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soldier, stand by, the monster may resist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You draw your back-sword, and I'll draw my fist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! mixt with air his worthless ghost has fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surgeon, his paleness speaks the monster dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part, part the sutures of his brazen scull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard as a rock, impenetrably dull.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold out his brain, and let his brethren see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tortoise brain, no larger than a pea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, rake his entrails, whet thy knife again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let's see what evils threat the next campaign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ministerial force shall prove too great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if the Congress save their mighty freight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See on his breast, deep grav'd with iron pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Passive obedience to the worst of men."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to his lights direct thy searching eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Slavery I love, and freedom I despise."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">View next his heart, his midriff just above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To my own country I'll a traitor prove."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by his throat, for utterance meant, I spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll fight for tyrants and their ministry."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crowded guts unnumber'd scrawls contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scandal of our country and the bane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bleeding entrails shew some great design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shall abortive prove, as I divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, freedom lost, nor danger do I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we can only with ourselves agree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like St. George, invincible I stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This home bred dragon stretch'd beneath my hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here may he lie, and let no traveller dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass green hillock o'er his carcase rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or heap up piles of monumental stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield from Ph&#339;bus and the stars his bones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This feat perform'd, I girt my magic gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And march'd, unlicens'd, from the guarded town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our fam'd camp I held my eager course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curious to view the courage and the force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those, whose hearts are flush'd with freedom's flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yet stand foremost in the field of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeply griev'd with their departing laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm in conviction of a righteous cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But e'er I reach'd the great encampment's bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friendly Genius on the way I found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful he smil'd his azure locks he shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from his lips these flowing accents broke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O mortal! guided by the fates and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view what thousands wish in vain to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to my care the magic vest restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chearful return to what thou wast before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to the shades this wond'rous mantle bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hang it safe in Fancy's temple there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let its loss provoke thee to repine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vest was Jove's, the will to lend it mine."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So said the God, and blending with the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walk'd conspicuous and reveal'd to sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more impervious to the human view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seeing all, and seen by others too.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now throngs on throngs on ev'ry side surround,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the burthen groans the heaving ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those fam'd afar to drive the deadly shot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With truest level to the central spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those whom Virginia's vast dominion sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her chaste streams and intervening lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who conscious of their country's claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pennsylvania's happy climate came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, and ten thousand more were scatter'd round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In black battalions on the tented ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepar'd, whene'er the trumpet's iron roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should summon forth to all the woes of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear with joy the loud alarming call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush perhaps to their own funeral.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just in the center of the camp arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An elm, whose shade invited to repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither I rov'd, and at the cool retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brave, tho' rough-cast, soldier chanc'd to meet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fop in arms, no feather on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No glittering toys the manly warrior had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His auburne face the least employ'd his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left it to the females to be fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho't the men, whom shining trifles sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pageant soldiers for a sun-shine day.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Marking my pensive step, his hand he laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his hard breast, and thus the warrior said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Stranger, observe, behold these warlike fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark well the ills, that civil discord yields:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No crimes of our's this vengeful doom require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our city ravag'd and our towns on fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troops pour'd on troops to Britain's lasting shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That threaten all with universal flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the kings, the monarchs of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exerting power in lawless tyranny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, hot for power, and burning for command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would rule the ocean and subject the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But while this arm the strength of man retains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While true-born courage revels through my veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll spill my blood yon' hostile force to quell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lawless power by lawful strength repel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This rough, black cannon shall our cause defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This black, rough cannon is my truest friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, arm'd with vengeance, belching death afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confus'd their thousands marching to the war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, deeply griev'd, the tears bedew my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, the greatest of calamities;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That our keen weapons, meant for other ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should spend their rage on Britons, once our friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Liberty!&mdash;no price hast thou below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en a Briton's life for thee must go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then, my weapons, rise in Freedom's aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her steps attend and be her call obey'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Carleton arm his antichristian might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sprinkle holy-water 'ere he fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him have, to shield his limbs from hurt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St. Stephen's breeches,[c] and St. Stephen's shirt,[c]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don Quixote's sword, the valiant knight of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which now may grace a madman's side again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St. Bernard's hose,[c] and lest we give too few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Faustus' cap, and Satan's cloven shoe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(These precious relicks may defend their backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good Guy Johnson should, I think, go snacks)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, let him, ere the clashing armies cope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procure a pardon from his friend the Pope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if his soul should be dislodg'd from hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven may with all his scarlet sins dispense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place him safe beyond the reach of ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Abrah'm's bosom may be had for all.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some powerful cause disarms my heart of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids me bring some future battle near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When crowds of dead shall veil the ghastful plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty Lords like Percy, fly again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every pulse with treble force shall beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each exert his valour to retreat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each shall wish his stature may be made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long as it seems at Sol's descending shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tallest trees that tour toward the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From simple acorns take their humble rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see from death their boasted valour shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And basely fly, has sometimes made me think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The true great heart is often found remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gay trappings of a scarlet coat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger, in pity lend one pensive sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all that dy'd and all that yet may die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If wars intestine long their rage retain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This land must turn a wilderness again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While civil discord plumes her snaky head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What streams of human gore most yet be shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sanguine floods shall Mystick's waves be dy'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ting'd the ocean, with her purple tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough.&mdash;The prospect fills my heart with woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the heart my freezing spirits flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more remains; no more than this, that all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must fight like Romans, or like Romans fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O heaven-born peace, renew thy wonted charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Neptune westward spreads his aged arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hostile lands return an honour'd guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless our crimson shores among the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till then may heaven assert our injur'd claims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And second every stroke Columbia aims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Direct our counsels and our leaders sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confound our foes and fill them with dismay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall past years, those happy years, return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And war's red lamp in Boston cease to burn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear and attest the warmest wish I bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God save the Congress and reform the King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long may Britannia rule our hearts again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rule as she rul'd in George the Second's reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May ages hence her growing empire see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she be glorious, but ourselves be free,<br /></span>

"Whereas the infatuated multitudes, who have long suffered themselves to be
conducted by certain well-known incendiaries and traitors, in a fatal progression
of crimes against the constitutional authority of the state, have at length
proceeded to avowed rebellion, and the good effects which were expected to
arise from the patience and lenity of the king's government have been often
frustrated, and are now rendered hopeless by the influence of the same evil
counsels, it only remains for those who are intrusted with the supreme rule, as
well for the punishment of the guilty as the protection of the well-affected, to
prove that they do not bear the sword in vain."</p></div>

the officers engaged in the cause of liberty and their country, who by the fortune
of war had fallen into your hands, have been thrown indiscriminately into
a common gaol appropriated for felons," and threatening retaliation in like
cases, "exactly by the rule you shall observe towards those of ours now in
your custody." To this Cage replied, on the 13th: "Britons, ever pre-eminent
in mercy, have outgone common examples, and overlooked the criminal
in the captive. Upon these principles your prisoners, whose lives, by the law
of the land, <i>are destined to the cord</i>, have hitherto been treated with care and
kindness," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Duyckinck.</i></p></div>

As far as I can ascertain, there exists but a single copy of this publication,
that in the possession of the Library Company of Philadelphia. A manuscript
note upon this copy, unquestionably the handwriting of Freneau, is as follows:
"By Gaine. Published October 25, 1775." The poem was manifestly written
after Gage's recall. The poet never reprinted it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_116_150" id="Footnote_116_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_150"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> On July 28, 1775, George III. wrote to Lord North: "I have desired
Lord Dartmouth to acquaint Lt. G. Gage that as he thinks nothing further can
be done this campaign in the province of Massachusetts Bay that he is desired
instantly to come over, that he may explain the various wants for carrying on
the next campaign." "It was a kindly pretext devised to spare the feelings of
an unprofitable but a faithful and a brave servant."&mdash;<i>Trevelyan.</i> General
Gage embarked at Boston for England, Oct. 12, 1775.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_117_151" id="Footnote_117_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_151"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> The scarcity of provisions in the British camp during the siege of Boston
has been already alluded to. "When marauding expeditions," says Bancroft,
"returned with sheep and hogs and cattle captured from islands, the bells were
rung as for victory."</p></div>

which established martial law throughout Massachusetts and proscribed Hancock

Boston, every member of the State Government and of the Continental Congress,
were threatened with condign punishment as rebels and traitors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_119_153" id="Footnote_119_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_153"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> Washington had written to Gage, remonstrating against the cruel treatment
of certain American officers, who were denied the privileges and immunities
due their rank. Almost the last official act of Gage was to reply through
Burgoyne in a letter addressed to "George Washington, Esqr.," that "Britons,
ever pre-eminent in mercy, have overlooked the criminal in the captive. Your
prisoners, whose lives by the law of the land are destined to the cord, have
hitherto been treated with care and kindness;&mdash;indiscriminately, it is true, for
I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the King."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_121_155" id="Footnote_121_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_155"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> This poem seems first to have appeared in the edition of 1786, where it
bore the title, "Female Frailty. Written <i>November 1775</i>." Freneau made use
of the opening speeches of Damon and Lucinda in his drama, <i>The Spy</i>. He
omitted the poem from the 1795 edition of his works, retaining, however, the
opening lyric, which he entitled "The Northern Soldier." The poem was
reprinted in the edition of 1809, the text of which I have used. The poet
edited the earlier version with great care, making verbal variations in almost
every line, and adding lines and even stanzas. I have marked only a few
of the more notable changes.</p></div>

<span class="i1">Long have I sat on this disast'rous shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sighing, sought to gain a passage o'er<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Great Jove in wrath a spark of genius gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade me drink the mad Pierian wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence came these rhimes, with truth ascrib'd to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If thus, tormented at these flighty lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You strive to blast what ne'er was meant for praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How will you bear the more exalted rhime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By labour polish'd, and matur'd by time?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Devoted madman! what inspir'd thy rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bade thy foolish muse with me engage?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have I from thee been urgent to attain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mean ideas of thy barren brain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I been seen in borrowed clothes to shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when detected, swear by Jove they're mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O miscreant, hostile to thine own repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy own envy thy destruction flows!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bless'd be our western world&mdash;its scenes conspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise a poet's fancy and his fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, blue-topt mountains to the skies ascend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, shady forests to the breezes bend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See mighty streams meandering to the main!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See lambs and lambkins sport on every plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spotted herds in flowery meadows see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what, ungenerous wretch, are these to thee?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You find no charms in all that nature yields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then leave to me the grottoes and the fields:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And truth disguise through all your mazy way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth you may gain, your clients you may squeeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by long cheating, learn to live at ease;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">O waft me far, ye muses of the west&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me your green bowers and soft seats of rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice happy in those dear retreats to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A safe retirement from all human kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dire misfortunes every step attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muse, still social, still remains a friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solitude her converse gives delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gay poetic dreams she cheers the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She aids me, shields me, bears me on her wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of growling whelps, to high, exalted things,<br /></span>

poet, which I have reproduced, and that in the 1809 edition, in which the title
is changed to "A Satire in Answer to a Hostile Attack. [First written, and
published 1775.]" From the nature of the concluding lines of the poem, it
may be inferred that it was the last work done by the poet before starting on
his voyage to the West Indies, late In November. I have not been able to
find a trace of the hostile attack in the newspapers or publications of the
period, or of the original publication of "Mac Swiggen." The poem was
omitted from the 1795 edition, only the first eight lines being used in the short
poem "To Shylock Ap-Shenken." The poet made many verbal changes for
the later edition, but I have marked only the most significant.</p></div>

<p class="cblockquot">A Vision</p>




<p class="nblockquot"><span class="smcap">Advertisement</span>&mdash;This Poem is founded upon the authority of Scripture, inasmuch
as these sacred books assert, that <i>the last enemy that shall be
conquered is Death</i>. For the purposes of poetry he is here personified,
and represented as on his dying bed. The scene is laid at a solitary
palace, (the time midnight) which, tho' before beautiful and joyous, is
now become sad and gloomy, as being the abode and receptacle of Death.
Its owner, an amiable, majestic youth, who had lately lost a beloved
consort, nevertheless with a noble philosophical fortitude and humanity,
entertains him in a friendly manner, and by employing Physicians,
endeavours to restore him to health, altho' an enemy; convinced of the
excellence and propriety of that divine precept, <i>If thine enemy hunger,
feed him; if he thirst, give him drink</i>. He nevertheless, as if by a spirit
of prophecy, informs this (fictitiously) wicked being of the certainty of
his doom, and represents to him in a pathetic manner the vanity of his
expectations, either of a reception into the abodes of the just, or continuing
longer to make havock of mankind upon earth. The patient
finding his end approaching, composes his epitaph, and orders it to be
engraved on his tombstone, hinting to us thereby, that even Death and
Distress have vanity; and would be remembered with honour after he
is no more, altho' his whole life has been spent in deeds of devastation
and murder. He dies at last in the utmost agonies of despair, after
agreeing with an avaricious Undertaker to intomb his bones. This
reflects upon the inhumanity of those men, who, not to mention an
enemy, would scarcely cover a departed friend with a little dust, without
certainty of reward for so doing. The circumstances of his funeral are
then recited, and the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears.
It concludes with a few reflections on the impropriety of a too great
attachment to the present life, and incentives to such moral virtue as
may assist in conducting us to a better.</p>

House of Night'</i>, a poem in the present number of the Magazine, is from
a young gentleman who has favoured us with several original pieces in the
course of this work; and readers of taste will no doubt be pleased with it,
as perfectly original both in the design and manner of it." It bore the title
"The House of Night; or, Six Hours Lodging with Death, A Vision," and
the quotation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Felix qui potiut rerum cognoscere causas,</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In the edition of 1795, Freneau used only stanzas 3-17, 119-124 of the
poem, giving it the title "The Vision of the Night. A Fragment." In this
there are some sixteen variations from the earlier text, nearly all minor verbal
changes not always for the better. Several, however, are significant, for
instance, line 12 is made to read, "I sing the horrors and the shades of
night"; line 32 is changed to "with her ebon spear"; line 478 to "raised
by churchmen's hands"; and 480 to "texts from Moses."
</p><p>
The poet used the 1786 edition as a sort of quarry for his later editions.
He used thirteen stanzas for "The Sexton's Sermon," q.v.; stanzas 39-43
were reprinted in the 1809 edition in connection with stanzas 35-38 of "Santa
Cruz" and entitled "Elegiac Lines"; stanza 79 became stanza one and 55
stanza two of the "Hessian Embarkation," and stanza 49 was inserted after
stanza 90 of the 1809 version of "Santa Cruz."</p></div>

February (1779) issue of the <i>United States Magazine</i>, as a part of an extended
article, with the title, "Account of the Island of Santa Cruz: Containing an
original Poem on the Beauties of that Island. In a letter to A. P. Esq." The
poem is introduced as follows: "I believe the best thing I can do with the rest
of this paper is to transcribe a few dull heavy lines which I composed near two
years ago on the spot." The poem consisted of fifty-two stanzas, corresponding
to the following above: 1-4, 6-10, 14-16, 18-23, 31-34, 39, 40, 48-51,
53, 54, 56, 58-63, 70, 79-82, 85, 88, 96, 98, 100, 101, 104, 106-108. Freneau
revised it with a careful hand for his edition of 1786. Some of the lines
changed most notably are as follows:</p>

<p>Each of the later editions passed under the revising pen of Freneau, but
the variations consisted largely of verbal changes. As a sample of his revision,
note the following:</p>

<p>Stanza 3, 1779, "Two weeks, with prosperous gales"; 1786, "Twice
seven days prosperous gales"; 1809, "Twice ten days prosperous gales";
26, 1779, "And tho' fierce Sol his beams directly shed"; 1786, "And though
the noon-sun all his radiance shed"; 1795, "The noon sun his fierce radiance
shed"; 30, 1779, "fruits that over-top the wood"; 1786, "fruits, the richest
of the wood"; 1795, "fruits the noblest of the wood"; 38, 1779, "peaked
hill"; 1786, "steepy hill"; 1795, "blue-brow'd hill"; 41, 1779, "lovely
green"; 1786, "lively green"; 1795, "liveliest green." Freneau added
three stanzas to the later versions. After stanza 16 above, be added the
following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The native here, in golden plenty blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bids from the soil the verdant harvests spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feasts in the abundant dome, the joyous guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time short,&mdash;life easy,&mdash;pleasure on the wing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Following this he added stanza 43 of "The Jamaica Funeral." Stanza 49 of
"The House of Night" was interpolated between 90 and 91. Stanzas 35-38
were omitted from the 1786 version, and in connection with stanzas 39-43 of
"The House of Night," became the "Elegiac Lines" of the later editions.
The text of the 1795 version was almost unrevised for the 1809 edition.</p>

1776) Washington remained firm and undaunted. In casting about for some
stronghold where he might make a desperate stand for the liberties of his
country, his thoughts reverted to the mountain regions of his early campaigns.
General Mercer was at hand, who had shared his perils among those mountains,
and his presence may have contributed to bring them to his mind.
'What think you.' said Washington, 'if we should retreat to the back parts of
Pennsylvania, would the Pennsylvanians support us?' 'If the lower counties
give up, the back counties will do the same,' was the discouraging reply.
'We must then retire to Augusta County, in Virginia,' said Washington.
'Numbers will repair to us for safety, and we will try a predatory war. If
overpowered, we must cross the Alleghanies.' Such was the indomitable
spirit, rising under difficulties and buoyant in the darkest moment, that kept
our tempest-tossed cause from foundering."&mdash;<i>Irving's Washington</i>, II, 448.</p></div>

</p><p>
"As Philadelphians we are entitled to some preeminence for our connection
with this peculiar frigate. After the close of the War of Independence,
she was owned in our city and employed as a merchant ship. When no longer
seaworthy, she has been stretched upon the margin of Petty's Island to remain
for a century to come, a spectacle to many river passengers."&mdash;<i>Watson's
Annals</i>, III, 338.
</p><p>
The <i>Alliance</i> was the only one of our first navy, of the class of frigates,
which escaped capture or destruction during the war. She was during the
Revolution what "Old Ironsides" became in later years, the idol of the
American people. She was in many engagements and was always victorious.
</p><p>
Freneau's poem first appeared, as far as I can find, in the 1786 edition.
It was probably written shortly after the launch of the frigate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_170_214" id="Footnote_170_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_214"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> This poem was first published as a pamphlet in 1781, by Francis Bailey
of Philadelphia, in connection with "The Prison Ship."
</p><p>
Nicholas Biddle, born in Philadelphia in 1750, was a sailor from his boyhood.
At one time he served beside Nelson in the British navy. In 1776,
when the new frigate <i>Randolph</i>, of thirty-two guns, was launched at Philadelphia,
he was made commander, and after several unimportant cruises he was
placed over a small fleet of war vessels, with the <i>Randolph</i> as flagship. In
March, 1779, he fell in with the British ship <i>Yarmouth</i>, and after a vigorous
action of twenty minutes, the <i>Randolph</i> was blown up by her own magazine,
only four men escaping with their lives.
</p><p>
Freneau has made several minor errors. The date 1776, which is found
on all the versions of the poem, should manifestly be 1779. The <i>Yarmouth</i>
did not attempt flight, nor did Biddle die at the moment of victory, as the poet
represents. In the words of Cooper, "Victory was almost hopeless, even had
all his vessels behaved equally well with his own ship." Captain Vincent had
only five men killed and twelve wounded at the time of the explosion, yet the
gallantry and skill of Biddle in the face of great odds justify all the praise that
Freneau gives him.</p></div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
